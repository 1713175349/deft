\section{Introduction}
The idea of liquids as composed of hard spheres dates back over two
millenia~\cite{lucretius}.  In the 20th century, we came to understand
atoms as inherently soft, but it was shown that their repulsion could
still be accurately described using a hard-sphere model, provided the
radius is chosen to be temperature
dependent~\cite{rowlinson1964statistical, barker1967perturbation,
  andersen1971relationship}.  These works cemented the hard-sphere
model as the reference system of choice for the theory of
liquids~\cite{gil-villegas-1997-SAFT-VR, clark2006developing,
  lafitte2013accurate}.  One reason for the wide use of the
hard-sphere fluid hard sphere fluid as a reference system is that it
is widely studied and well understood, but only for the homogeneous
fluid~\cite{carnahan1969equation}, but also in the more challenging
case of the inhomogeneous fluid~\cite{rosenfeld1989, rosenfeld1997,
  roth2002whitebear}.  However, the hard-sphere fluid remains a
non-physical model, which is also numerically inconvenient in its use
of delta functions.

Fundamental Measure Theory~(FMT) is a classical density functional
theory for the free energy of the hard-sphere fluid developed by
Rosenfeld~\cite{rosenfeld1989}.  Due to its combination of
computational efficiency with accuracy, FMT has since been used as the
basis for a wide variety of classical density
functionals~\cite{cuesta1997dimensional, hansen2009fundamental,
  marechal2013density}.
%
In 1999, Schmidt introduced \emph{Soft} Fundamental Measure Theory
(SFMT)~\cite{schmidt1999density}, which directly treats soft repulsive
potentials in a framework based on the highly successful FMT developed
by Rosenfeld~\cite{rosenfeld1989}.  SFMT has been used to describe the
behavior of a star polymer in solution~\cite{schmidt2000density,
  groh2001density, kim2001adsorption, sweatman2002fundamental}, as
well as repulsive potentials applicable to
atoms~\cite{schmidt2000fluid, sweatman2002fundamental}.

%% In his 2010 review of FMT, Roth states that the most important future
%% developments in equilibrium DFT will involve treating soft repulsions
%% and attractions~\cite{}.

In this paper, we will apply SFMT to study the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson
(WCA) repulsive potential~\cite{weeks1971}.  This potential reproduces
the repulsive force of a Lennard-Jones interaction, which makes it an
ideal model for interatomic repulsion.  Mathematically, the WCA
pair potential is given by
\begin{align}
  V_{wca}(r) =
  \begin{cases}
    4\epsilon \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} -
    \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{6} \right] + \epsilon, & 0 < r < 2R \\
    0, & \textrm{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
where $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ are the usual Lennard-Jones parameters
and $R$ is a single sphere radius.  In this paper we will used the
dimensionless reduced density $n^* \equiv n \sigma^3$ and reduced
temperature $T^* \equiv k_BT/\epsilon$.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Soft Fundamental Measure Theory}

SFMT is a generalization of FMT to soft interactions. \fixme{An
  advantage of FMT, as Schmidt points outs, is that the range of the
  weighted densities is at a distance of one sphere radius}. In SFMT,
the weight functions are modified but retain: the direct correlation
in the low-density limit, the exact free energy in the
zero-dimensional cavity limit, and relation to the generating weight
function $w_3(\rr)$~\cite{schmidt1999density}. The new weight
functions are also made to deconvolve the Mayer function,
\begin{equation}
  f(r) = \exp (-\beta V(r)) - 1
\end{equation}
(where $\beta = 1/k_BT$), and retain the same weight function
dependencies from FMT\fixme{redundant?}
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{n}_{V2} &= \mathbf{\nabla} n_3 , \quad
  \mathbf{n}_{V1} = \frac{\mathbf{n}_{V2}}{4\pi R}
  \label{eq:n-vectors}\\
  n_1 &= \frac{n_2}{4\pi R} , \quad
  n_0 = \frac{n_2}{4\pi R^2} 
  \label{eq:n-0-1}\\
  &\hspace{0.5 cm} n_3 = -\int n_2 ~\textrm{d}r.
  \label{eq:n-3}
\end{align}

Furthermore, Schmidt shows~\cite{schmidt2000fluid} that $n_2$ is
related to the Mayer function by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mayerandw2}
  \frac{d f(r)}{dr} = \int dr' w_2(r') w_2 (r-r').
\end{equation}
This gives two options for constructing a theory directly using SFMT:
choose a pair potential and solve for $w_2$(difficult) or construct a
$w_2$ and verify that the pair potential is reasonable.

\subsection{Barker-Henderson hard sphere}

Another approach to account for the temperature dependence of
realistic fluids is Barker-Herson's
approach\cite{barker1967perturbation}. This theory takes any general
repulsive pair potential, $V(r)$, and creates a hard sphere reference fluid
with a temperature dependent diameter and higher order repulsive
terms. The hard sphere diameter is
\begin{align}
  d = \int_0^{\sigma_{BH}}\left( 1 - e^{\beta V(r)} \right)\mathrm{dr}
  \label{eq:bh-diameter}
\end{align} 
where $\sigma_{BH}$ is the radius for which $V(r)$ goes to zero. We
utilize this variable diameter to create a White
Bear~\cite{roth2002whitebear} hard sphere DFT and compare its behavior
with the soft sphere DFT we construct in this paper.

\subsection{Our Theory}

We use the White Bear version of the Fundamental-Measure Theory~(FMT)
functional published in reference~\cite{roth2002whitebear}.  The FMT
functional describes the excess free energy of a hard-sphere fluid.
This particular FMT reduces to the Carnahan-Starling equation of state
for homogeneous systems.
\begin{equation}
A_\textit{HS}[n] = k_B T \int \left(\Phi_1(\rr) + \Phi_2(\rr) + \Phi_3(\rr)\right) d\rr \; ,
\end{equation}
with integrands
\begin{align}
\Phi_1 &= -n_0 \ln\left( 1 - n_3\right)\\
\Phi_2 &= \frac{n_1 n_2 - \mathbf{n}_{V1} \cdot\mathbf{n}_{V2}}{1-n_3} \\
\Phi_3 &= (n_2^3 - 3 n_2 \mathbf{n}_{V2} \cdot \mathbf{n}_{V2}) \frac{
  n_3 + (1-n_3)^2 \ln(1-n_3)
}{
  36\pi n_3^2\left( 1 - n_3 \right)^2
} ,
\end{align}
using the weighted densities
\begin{align}
  n_3(\rr) &= \int n(\rr') \Theta(\left|\rr - \rr'\right| - R) d\rr' \\
  n_2(\rr) &= \int n(\rr') \delta(\left|\rr - \rr'\right| - R) d\rr'
  \label{eq:white-bear-n2}
\end{align}

We modify $n_2(\rr)$ to approximate the SFMT relation in
Equation~\ref{eq:mayerandw2}, and utilize the relations in
Equations~\ref{eq:n-vectors}-\ref{eq:n-3} to construct a new free
energy functional.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/potential-plot}
\end{center}
\caption{plot of potential.}
\label{fig:potential-plot}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/w2-comparison}
\end{center}
\caption{plot of potential.}
\label{fig:w2-comparison}
\end{figure}
First, we approximate the Mayer function as an error function in order
to deconvolve analytically similar to Schmidt~\cite{schmidt2000fluid}
\begin{align}
  f(r) \approx \tfrac12 \left( \mathrm{erf}\left( \frac{r - \alpha}{\Xi} \right) - 1 \right).
  \label{eq:mayer-approx}
\end{align}
The pair potential for this function is given by
\begin{align}
  V_{erf}(r) = -kT\ln\left[\tfrac12 \left( \mathrm{erf}\left( \frac{r -
    \alpha}{\Xi} \right) + 1 \right) \right].
\end{align}
where $\alpha$ and $\Xi$ are fitting parameters that will be used to
\fixme{match} $V_{erf}$ to the WCA potential. Expanding $V_{erf}(r)$ in a
power series gives the approximation ar $r=\alpha$
\begin{align}
  V_{erf}(\alpha) &\approx k_BT \ln 2.
\end{align}
Setting $V_{wca}(\alpha) = V_{erf}(\alpha)$, we solve for $\alpha$ and
find that
\begin{align}
  \alpha = \sigma \left( \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{\frac{k_BT}{\epsilon}
        \ln 2}} \right)^{\frac{1}{6}}.
\end{align}
We then evalueate the slope of both potentials at $r = \alpha$ and set
them equal. This yields the other fitting parameter
\begin{align}
  \Xi = \frac{\alpha}{6\sqrt{\pi} \left( \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{k_BT} \ln
      2} + \ln 2 \right)}
\end{align}
We plot the results of this approximation in
Figures~\ref{fig:potential-plot} and \ref{fig:w2-comparison}. In
Figure~\ref{fig:potential-plot} we see the temperature dependence of
the approximation in comparison to the WCA potential. Vertical dotted
lines show the $\alpha$ at which $V_{erf}$ and $V_{wca}$ are matched.

Figure~\ref{fig:w2-comparison} compares the dervative of the Mayer
function with a WCA pair potential to the derivative of our
approximate $f(r)$ from Equation~\ref{eq:mayer-approx}. The two
leftmost verticle lines show the $\alpha$ where the potential
functions have been matched, and the rightmost shows where the WCA
potential, and thus f', goes to zero. Our approximation does exist
slightly past the WCA cutoff for both temperatures but quickly go to
zero in a reasonable interval. The lower temperature is more peaked
and closer to the cutoff which produces more disagreement. This is
demonstrated within our results where we find lower temperatures to be
less accurate.

The approximate weight functions from the erf model are
\begin{align}
  w_2(r) &= \frac{1}{\Xi \sqrt{\pi}} e^{-\frac{(r-\alpha/2)^2}{\Xi^2}} \\
  w_3(r) &= \tfrac12 ( 1 - \mathrm{erf}((r-\alpha/2)/\Xi) ).
\end{align}
with all other weight functions retaining their relation to $w_2(r)$
as in FMT.

\subsection{Weighting functions in fourier space}

We Fourier transform our weight functions to perform simulations in
Fourier space.  We find that
\begin{align}
  \tilde{w}_3(k) &= \frac{4\pi}{k} \int_0^\infty r w_3(r) \sin(kr) dr \\ 
  &= \frac{4\sqrt{\pi}}{k^3}\int_{-\sigma/2a}^\infty \left[
    \sin(k(au+\frac{\sigma}{2})) - k(au + \frac{\sigma}{2})
    \cos(k(au+\frac{\sigma}{2}))\right] e^{-u^2} du.
\end{align}
This is not an analytic function, but we assume that we are working at
low enough temperatures so that our function reduces to zero by $u=
-\frac{\sigma}{2a}$. We extend the lower limit to $-\infty$ then
\begin{align}
  \tilde{w}_3(k) &\approx
  \frac{4\pi}{k^3}e^{-\left(\frac{ak}{2}\right)^2}\left[ \left(1 +
    \frac{a^2k^2}{2} \right) \sin\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) -
    \frac{k}{2} \sigma\cos\left(\frac{k \sigma}{2}\right) \right]
\end{align}

We apply the same method to the other weight functions. These are
\begin{align}
  \tilde{w}_2(k) &=\frac{2\pi}{k} e^{-\left(\frac{ak}{2} \right)^2}
  \bigg(a^2 k \cos\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) \notag \\
  & \hspace{8em}+\sigma \sin\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) \bigg) \\ 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \tilde{w}_1(k) &=
  \frac{1}{k}e^{-\left(\frac{ak}{2} \right)^2}
  \sin\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) \\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \tilde{\mathbf{w}}_{2V}(\kk) &=
  \frac{i \pi}{k} e^{-\left(\frac{ak}{2} \right)^2}\bigg[ \left(\sigma^2 - a^4k^2\right)
    \cos\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) \notag\\ 
    & \hspace{5em}- 2\sigma \left(a^2k + \frac{1}{k}
    \right)\sin\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) \bigg]
  \mathbf{\hat{k}} \\ 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \mathbf{\tilde{w}}_{1V}(k)&= \frac{i}{k}
   e^{-\left(\frac{ak}{2} \right)^2} \bigg[ \frac{\sigma}{2}
    \cos\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) \notag\\
    & \hspace{6em}- \left( \frac{a^2k}{2} +
    \frac{1}{k} \right) \sin\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) \bigg]
  \mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{align}
$\tilde{w}_0(k)$ contains a $\frac{1}{r}$ term that expands the
integrand  as an infinite series. The first two terms were kept and
could be expressed in terms of $\tilde{w}_1(k)$ and
$\tilde{w}_2(k)$.
\begin{align}
  \tilde{w}_0(k) &= \frac{2}{\sigma} \left[2\tilde{w}_1(k) - \frac{1}{2 \pi
      \sigma}\tilde{w}_2(k) \right]
  \label{eq:w0-k}
\end{align}
This results in another approximation we must make. In real space we modify $n_0$ to agree with Equation~\ref{eq:w0-k}. So
\begin{align} 
 n_0(\rr) \approx \frac{2}{\alpha} \left[2 n_1(\rr) - \frac{1}{2
     \pi \alpha} n_2(\rr) \right]
\end{align}

\section{Results}

For all of our simulations, we construct a Barker-Henderson hard
sphere fluid with a diameter determined by Eq.~\ref{eq:bh-diameter}
using the WCA potential as the pair potential. The BH fluid is known
to give good restuls, so we use it as a reference for our DFT.

\subsection{Homogeneous limit}

As a simple test for the equation of state, we compare the theory for
a homogeneous soft-sphere fluid to MC simulation. The results
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:p-vs-packing} display very good agreement for
lower densities across all temperatures shown in Figure and at higher
temperatures which are not shown. Differences between the DFT(solid
lines) and MC results(dotted lines) become quite apparent at $n^*=0.6$
and above which includes fluid to solid transitions starting at
$n^*=0.8$ that are not predicted by our DFT in the pressure. Our
theory consistently predicts higher pressure which suggests
\fixme{something?}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figs/p-vs-T}
\end{center}
\caption{Pressure versus packing fraction.  The SFMT result is plotted
  as solid lines, with simulation results as solid circles.  The
  pressure is divided by the hard-sphere pressure in each case, in
  order to highlight the effect of the soft interactions.}
\label{fig:p-vs-packing}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Soft spheres radial distribution function}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figs/radial-distribution}
\end{center}
\caption{Radial distribution functions with 0.6(top) and 1.0(bottom) reduced densities.}
\label{fig:radial-distribution}
\end{figure}

For three dimensional comparisons, we plot radial distribution
funtions.  Results for reduced densitied below $n^* = 0.60$ have been
ommitted as they were exact over temperature ranges from $T^*=0.01$ to
$T^*=10$. The top frame of Figure \ref{fig:radial-distribution} shows
the radial distribution for a range of temperatures at a redued
density of $n^* = 0.60$. We see very good agreement of our DFT with
Monte-Carlo simulation at this reduced density. Our DFT's behaviour at
higher temperatures are in almost exact agreement, while the lower
temperatures have slight disagreement just after the first peak at
contact and in the subsequent oscillations where it
\fixme{underestimate} the peaks. Comparison with the Barker-Henderson
results shows our DFT to have a similar magnitude of error to the
exact radial distribution function.

In Figure \ref{fig:radial-distribution}(bottom), we plot the results
for a reduced density of $n^*=1.0$ for three different
tempreatures. While both Barker-Henderson hard spheres and our DFT
both overstimate the density at contact, our theory differs more at
the lowest temperature shown here. For the density oscillations, our
DFT's error is as good as the Barker-Henderson results.

\subsection{Soft spheres near a hard wall}

As a test for one dimensional behavior, we will look at the density
profile for the soft sphere fluid near a hard wall in
Figure~\ref{fig:hard-walls}. The top plot shows density profiles for
$n^*=0.6$ and the bottom for $n^*=1.0$. We see that lower densities
and higher temperatures produce almost exact results, while lower
temperatures and higher densities reveal disagreement.


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figs/hard-walls}
\end{center}
\caption{Density distribution near a hard wall.}
\label{fig:hard-walls}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Soft spheres near a soft wall}

If we construct a wall of WCA spheres of density $\rho$, we
find that the potential at a distance z from the wall is

\begin{align}
V_{SW}(0 < z \leq R_0) &= 2\pi\rho\epsilon\Big[ \frac{z^3-R_0^3}{6} +
  \frac{2\sigma_W^{12}}{45} \left(\frac{1}{z^9}-\frac{1}{R_0^9}\right)
  \notag \\
  &+ \left( R_0 - z \right)\left(\frac{R_0^2}{2} +
  \frac{\sigma_W^6}{R_0^4} - \frac{2\sigma_W^{12}}{5R_0^{10}}\right)
  \notag \\
  &\hspace{2cm}+\frac{\sigma_W^6}{3}\left(\frac{1}{R_0^3}-\frac{1}{z^3}
  \right) \Bigg].
\label{eq:soft-wall-potential}
\end{align}
The distance $R_0$ is equal to a radius of a sphere which makes up the
wall plus the radius of a sphere in the fluid. Both $\epsilon$ and
$\sigma_W$ are Lennard-Jones parameters between the wall and the
fluid.

In Figure \ref{fig:soft-walls}, we compare our soft sphere DFT
against MC simulation and a BH fluid near a soft wall
with the potential given in Equation \ref{eq:soft-wall-potential}. We
plot the reduced density versus reduced distance from the surface of
the wall for $n^*=0.6$ at different temperatures. Again, the results
of our soft sphere fluid is as good as the BH fluid
overall.

\label{fig:soft-walls}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Argon}

We compare our theory and BH data with experimental data for Argon. In
Figure~\ref{fig:argon-plots} we plot the radial distribution function
for three argon fluids~\cite{mikolaj2004structure,
  eggert2002quantitative, yarnell1973structure} and plot our soft
fluid theory, MC data, and a BH fluid about a Lenard-Jones test
particle. The Lennard-Jones parameters used for Argon are $\sigma = 3.405
~\textrm{\AA}$ and $\epsilon = 119.8$~K~\cite{verlet1967computer}. Our
theory shows a very good agreement with the BH fluid while both
overestimate density at contact.

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, our theory is \fixme{pretty awesome}. The theory
presented in this paper is as good as a Barker-Henderson hard sphere
fluid for a range of densities and temperatures. The advantage of our
theory is that we can use it \emph{as is} rather than needing to
accomodate for discontinuities and delta functions of hard sphere
fluids.
