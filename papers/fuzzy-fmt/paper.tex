\section{Introduction}
The idea of liquids as composed of hard spheres dates back over two
millenia~\cite{lucretius}.  In the 20th century, we came to understand
atoms as inherently soft, but it was shown that their repulsion could
still be accurately described using a hard-sphere model, provided the
radius is chosen to be temperature
dependent~\cite{rowlinson1964statistical, barker1967perturbation,
  andersen1971relationship}.  These works cemented the hard-sphere
model as the reference system of choice for the theory of
liquids~\cite{gil-villegas-1997-SAFT-VR, clark2006developing,
  lafitte2013accurate}.  One reason for the wide use of the
hard-sphere fluid hard sphere fluid as a reference system is that it
is widely studied and well understood, but only for the homogeneous
fluid~\cite{carnahan1969equation}, but also in the more challenging
case of the inhomogeneous fluid~\cite{rosenfeld1989, rosenfeld1997,
  roth2002whitebear}.  However, the hard-sphere fluid remains a
non-physical model, which is also numerically inconvenient in its use
of delta functions.

Fundamental Measure Theory~(FMT) is a classical density functional
theory for the free energy of the hard-sphere fluid developed by
Rosenfeld~\cite{rosenfeld1989}.  Due to its combination of
computational efficiency with accuracy, FMT has since been used as the
basis for a wide variety of classical density
functionals~\cite{cuesta1997dimensional, hansen2009fundamental,
  marechal2013density}.
%
In 1999, Schmidt introduced \emph{Soft} Fundamental Measure Theory
(SFMT)~\cite{schmidt1999density}, which directly treats soft repulsive
potentials in a framework based on the highly successful FMT developed
by Rosenfeld~\cite{rosenfeld1989}.  SFMT has been used to describe the
behavior of a star polymer in solution~\cite{schmidt2000density,
  groh2001density, kim2001adsorption, sweatman2002fundamental}, as
well as repulsive potentials applicable to
atoms~\cite{schmidt2000fluid, sweatman2002fundamental}.

%% In his 2010 review of FMT, Roth states that the most important future
%% developments in equilibrium DFT will involve treating soft repulsions
%% and attractions~\cite{}.

In this paper, we will apply SFMT to study the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson
(WCA) repulsive potential~\cite{weeks1971}.  This potential reproduces
the repulsive force of a Lennard-Jones interaction, which makes it an
ideal model for interatomic repulsion.  Mathematically, the WCA
pair potential is given by
\newcommand\erf{\mathrm{erf}}
\newcommand\Vwca{V_{\mathrm{wca}}}
\newcommand\Verf{V_{\erf}}
\begin{align}
  \Vwca(r) =
  \begin{cases}
    4\epsilon \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} -
    \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{6} \right] + \epsilon, & 0 < r < 2R \\
    0, & \textrm{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
where $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ are the usual Lennard-Jones parameters
and $R$ is a single sphere radius.  In this paper we will used the
dimensionless reduced density $n^* \equiv n \sigma^3$ and reduced
temperature $T^* \equiv k_BT/\epsilon$.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Soft Fundamental Measure Theory}

Soft fundamental measure theory (SFMT) is a generalization of FMT to
soft interactions developed by
Schmidt~\cite{schmidt1999density}. \fixme{An advantage of FMT, as
  Schmidt points outs, is that the range of the weighted densities is
  at a distance of one sphere radius}.  Like Rosenfeld's
FMT~\cite{rosenfeld1989}, the free energy is written as an integral of
functions of a set of weighted densities known as \emph{fundamental
  measures}:
\begin{equation}
A_\textit{HS}[n] = k_B T \int \left(\Phi_1(\rr) + \Phi_2(\rr) +
\Phi_3(\rr)\right) d\rr \; ,
\end{equation}
with integrands
\begin{align}
\Phi_1 &= -n_0 \ln\left( 1 - n_3\right)\\
\Phi_2 &= \frac{n_1 n_2 - \mathbf{n}_{V1} \cdot\mathbf{n}_{V2}}{1-n_3} \\
\Phi_3 &= \frac{n_2^3/3 - n2\mathbf{n}_{V2}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{V2}^2}{8*\pi*(1-n_3)^2}
\end{align}
which is derived from dimensional crossover from the exact free energy
in the zero-dimensional cavity limit.  The fundamental measures
\begin{equation}
  n_{i}(\textbf{r}) = \int
  n(\textbf{r}')w_i(|\textbf{r}-\textbf{r}'|) d\textbf{r}'
  \label{eq:n-convolution}
\end{equation}
are defined as convolutions with weight functions similar to those of
hard-sphere FMT. Like hard-sphere fundamental measures, the new weight
functions are constructed so as to deconvolve the Mayer function,
\begin{equation}
  f(r) = \exp (-\beta V(r)) - 1
\end{equation}
where $\beta = 1/k_BT$.  The weighting functions are related by
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{w}_{V2} &= w_2\frac{\textbf{r}}{r} &
  \mathbf{w}_{V1} &= w_1\frac{\textbf{r}}{r}
  \label{eq:n-vectors}\\
  w_1 &= \frac{w_2}{4\pi R} &
  w_0 &= \frac{w_2}{4\pi R^2}
  \label{eq:n-0-1}
\end{align}
\begin{equation}
   w_3(r) = \int_{r}^{\infty} w_2(r') dr',
  \label{eq:n-3}
\end{equation}
where it is helpful to note that the integral in Eq.~\ref{eq:n-3} is
a one-dimentional integral over radius.

Furthermore, Schmidt proves that SFMT produces the exact functional in
the low-density limit, provided the weighting function that defines
$n_2$ is related to the Mayer function by a convolution
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mayerandw2}
  \frac{d f(r)}{dr} = \int dr' w_2(r') w_2 (r-r'),
\end{equation}
with the other weighting functions given by the equations
above~\cite{schmidt2000fluid}.  We note that these equations are
satisfied by traditional hard-sphere FMT as well as SFMT, for the same
reason: they are needed in order to ensure the correct low-density
behavior.  Equation~\ref{eq:mayerandw2} is the challenge point for
SFMT: deconvolving the Mayer $f$ function for a realistic potential is
challenging, which has limited the number of applications of this
theory to simple liquids.

There are two options for constructing a theory directly using SFMT:
either one must choose a pair potential and deconvolve the Mayer
function to solve for $w_2$---which is difficult---or one can
construct a $w_2$ and solve for the pair potential that weighting
function represents.  Both approaches are used in the original papers
introducing SFMT, where the latter is exemplified by the ``erf
potential''~\cite{schmidt1999density, schmidt2000fluid}. \fixme{From
  home I don't have ready access to these papers, so please check that
  what I'm writing is true, and adjust the terminology for ``erf
  potential'' to match what Schmidt writes.  Better if we can restrict
  ourselves to citing the first paper here, which was actually
  original.}

The ``erf potential'' introduced in Ref.~\citenum{schmidt1999density}
corresponds to a Gaussian form for the weighting function $w_2$
The approximate weight functions from the erf model are
\begin{align}
  w_2(r) &= \frac{1}{\Xi \sqrt{\pi}} e^{-\frac{(r-\alpha/2)^2}{\Xi^2}}
  \label{eq:gaussianw2}
\end{align}
where $\Xi$ and $\alpha$ are parameters with dimensions of length.
This choice for $w_2$ results in a form containing an error function
for the $w_3$ weighting function, the Mayer $f$ function, and the pair
potential:
\begin{align}
  w_3(r) &= \tfrac12 \left( 1 - \mathrm{erf}\left(\frac{r-\alpha/2}{\Xi}\right) \right) \\
  f(r) &= \tfrac12 \left( \mathrm{erf}\left( \frac{r - \alpha}{\Xi} \right) - 1 \right)
  \label{eq:mayer-approx} \\
  \Verf(r) &= -kT\ln\left[\tfrac12 \left( \mathrm{erf}\left( \frac{r -
    \alpha}{\Xi} \right) + 1 \right) \right].\label{eq:Verf}
\end{align}
The ``erf potential'' is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:potential-plot}, and
the first derivative of the Mayer $f$ function corresponding to this
potential is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:w2-comparison}.  Sadly, as is
evident from Eq.~\ref{eq:Verf}, this simple functional relationship
only holds for one chosen temperature.  At other temperatures, the
same potential leads to an entirely different form for $f$ and $w_2$,
which is not analytically tractable.

\subsection{Barker-Henderson hard sphere}

Another approach to account for the temperature dependence of
realistic fluids is Barker-Herson's
approach\cite{barker1967perturbation}. This theory takes any general
repulsive pair potential, $V(r)$, and creates a hard sphere reference fluid
with a temperature dependent diameter and higher order repulsive
terms. The hard sphere diameter is
\begin{align}
  d = \int_0^{\sigma_{BH}}\left( 1 - e^{\beta V(r)} \right)\mathrm{dr}
  \label{eq:bh-diameter}
\end{align}
where $\sigma_{BH}$ is the radius for which $V(r)$ goes to zero.  We
utilize this variable diameter to create a White
Bear~\cite{roth2002whitebear} hard sphere DFT and compare its behavior
with the soft sphere DFT we construct in this paper.

We use the White Bear version of the Fundamental-Measure Theory~(FMT)
functional~\cite{roth2002whitebear}, which describes the excess free
energy of an inhomogeneous hard-sphere fluid.  The White Bear
functional reduces to the Carnahan-Starling free energy for
homogeneous systems, and has been found to be accurate under a wide
range of inhomogeneous configurations.
\begin{equation}
A_\textit{HS}[n] = k_B T \int \left(\Phi_1(\rr) + \Phi_2(\rr) + \Phi_3(\rr)\right) d\rr \; ,
\end{equation}
with integrands
\begin{align}
\Phi_1 &= -n_0 \ln\left( 1 - n_3\right)\\
\Phi_2 &= \frac{n_1 n_2 - \mathbf{n}_{V1} \cdot\mathbf{n}_{V2}}{1-n_3} \\
\Phi_3 &= (n_2^3 - 3 n_2 \mathbf{n}_{V2} \cdot \mathbf{n}_{V2}) \frac{
  n_3 + (1-n_3)^2 \ln(1-n_3)
}{
  36\pi n_3^2\left( 1 - n_3 \right)^2
} ,
\end{align}
using the weighted density
\begin{align}
  n_2(\rr) &= \int n(\rr') w_2(\left|\rr - \rr'\right| - R) d\rr' \\
           &= \int n(\rr') \delta(\left|\rr - \rr'\right| - R) d\rr'
  \label{eq:white-bear-n2}
\end{align}
where the remaining weighted densities are given by
Eqs.~\ref{eq:n-convolution} through~\ref{eq:n-3}.

\subsection{Soft FMT for the WCA fluid}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/potential-plot}
\end{center}
\caption{The WCA potential, and approximations to this potential
  constructed for two different temperatures.}
\label{fig:potential-plot}
\end{figure}

Our approach to model the WCA fluid is to approximate the WCA
potential by using the erf potential with temperature-dependent
parameters.  We select the parameters $\Xi$ and $\alpha$ to match the
value and derivative of $\Verf(r)$ and $\Vwca(r)$ at the distance
$\alpha$, corresponding to the maximum slope of the Mayer $f$
function.  In essence, this is similar to the Barker-Henderson
approach, in which a hard-sphere potential with temperature-dependent
diameter is used to model a soft repulsive fluid.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/w2-comparison}
\end{center}
\caption{The derivative of the Mayer $f$ function from the WCA
  potential, and the convolution of the fitted Gaussian $w_2$ with
  itself at two different temperatures.  According to
  Eq.~\ref{eq:mayerandw2} these should be identical in order to
  accurately reproduce the low-density behavior of the fluid.}
\label{fig:w2-comparison}
\end{figure}

We begin by equating the values of the potentials at distance $\alpha$
tells us that the $\alpha$ parameter must be given by
\begin{align}
  \alpha = \sigma \left( \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{\frac{k_BT}{\epsilon}
        \ln 2}} \right)^{\frac{1}{6}}.
\end{align}
The alpha parameter roughly measures the length-scale of the
interaction, and like the Barker-Henderson diameter, decreases with
increasing temperature.  Finally, equating the slope of both
potentials at $r = \alpha$ yields the other parameter
\begin{align}
  \Xi = \frac{\alpha}{6\sqrt{\pi} \left( \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{k_BT} \ln
      2} + \ln 2 \right)},
\end{align}
which is a measure of the effective softness of the interaction, and
increases with the temperature.  We show the resulting approximation
for the potential in Figures~\ref{fig:potential-plot} for two
different temperatures.  We see the temperature dependence of the
approximation in comparison to the WCA potential, with the
approximation at higher temperatures being more accurate for smaller
differences. Vertical dotted lines show the values of $\alpha$ at
which $\Verf$ and $\Vwca$ are matched, a solid black vertical line
represents the distance at which the WCA force goes to zero, and the
horizontal dotted lines illustrate the two temperatures.  At both
temperatures, the largest deviations are seen at very small distances,
and thus very high potential energies.

Figure~\ref{fig:w2-comparison} compares the dervative of the Mayer $f$
function corresponding to the WCA pair potential with convolution of
the the fitted Gaussian $w_2$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:gaussianw2} with
itself, as in Eq.~\ref{eq:mayerandw2}.  The two vertical dotted lines
show the $\alpha$ where the potential functions have been matched, and
the the solid vertical line shows where the WCA force, and potential,
and thus $f'_{\mathrm{wca}}$, goes to zero. The erf result extends
slightly past the cutoff at which $f'_{\mathrm{wca}}$ vanishes for
both temperatures, but does quickly go to zero. At lower lower
temperatures $w_2$ and $f'$are more peaked and approach the cutoff, as
the system approaches hard-sphere behavior in which these functions
are Dirac $\delta$ functions.

In Appendix~\ref{sec:fourier} we provide analytical expressions for
the Fourier transforms of each of the weighting functions.  In this
step, we make one additional approximation beyond the erf
approximation, which is to approximate $w_0$ as a linear combination
of $w_1$ and $w_2$, which results from a power series approximation
valid in the low-temperature limit, when $\Xi\ll\alpha$.

\section{Results}

For all of our simulations, we construct a Barker-Henderson hard
sphere fluid with a diameter determined by Eq.~\ref{eq:bh-diameter}
using the WCA potential as the pair potential. The BH fluid is known
to give good restuls, so we use it as a reference for our DFT.

\subsection{Homogeneous limit}

As a simple test for the equation of state, we compare the theory for
a homogeneous soft-sphere fluid to MC simulation. The results
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:p-vs-packing} display very good agreement for
lower densities across all temperatures shown in Figure and at higher
temperatures which are not shown. Differences between the DFT(solid
lines) and MC results(dotted lines) become quite apparent at $n^*=0.6$
and above which includes fluid to solid transitions starting at
$n^*=0.8$ that are not predicted by our DFT in the pressure. Our
theory consistently predicts higher pressure which suggests
\fixme{something?}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figs/p-vs-T}
\end{center}
\caption{Pressure versus packing fraction.  The SFMT result is plotted
  as solid lines, with simulation results as solid circles.  The
  pressure is divided by the hard-sphere pressure in each case, in
  order to highlight the effect of the soft interactions.}
\label{fig:p-vs-packing}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Soft spheres radial distribution function}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figs/radial-distribution}
\end{center}
\caption{Radial distribution functions with 0.6(top) and 1.0(bottom) reduced densities.}
\label{fig:radial-distribution}
\end{figure}

For three dimensional comparisons, we plot radial distribution
funtions.  Results for reduced densitied below $n^* = 0.60$ have been
ommitted as they were exact over temperature ranges from $T^*=0.01$ to
$T^*=10$. The top frame of Figure \ref{fig:radial-distribution} shows
the radial distribution for a range of temperatures at a redued
density of $n^* = 0.60$. We see very good agreement of our DFT with
Monte-Carlo simulation at this reduced density. Our DFT's behaviour at
higher temperatures are in almost exact agreement, while the lower
temperatures have slight disagreement just after the first peak at
contact and in the subsequent oscillations where it
\fixme{underestimate} the peaks. Comparison with the Barker-Henderson
results shows our DFT to have a similar magnitude of error to the
exact radial distribution function.

In Figure \ref{fig:radial-distribution}(bottom), we plot the results
for a reduced density of $n^*=1.0$ for three different
tempreatures. While both Barker-Henderson hard spheres and our DFT
both overstimate the density at contact, our theory differs more at
the lowest temperature shown here. For the density oscillations, our
DFT's error is as good as the Barker-Henderson results.

\subsection{Soft spheres near a hard wall}

As a test for one dimensional behavior, we will look at the density
profile for the soft sphere fluid near a hard wall in
Figure~\ref{fig:hard-walls}. The top plot shows density profiles for
$n^*=0.6$ and the bottom for $n^*=1.0$. We see that lower densities
and higher temperatures produce almost exact results, while lower
temperatures and higher densities reveal disagreement.


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figs/hard-walls}
\end{center}
\caption{Density distribution near a hard wall.}
\label{fig:hard-walls}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Soft spheres near a soft wall}

If we construct a wall of WCA spheres of density $\rho$, we
find that the potential at a distance z from the wall is

\begin{align}
V_{SW}(0 < z \leq R_0) &= 2\pi\rho\epsilon\Big[ \frac{z^3-R_0^3}{6} +
  \frac{2\sigma_W^{12}}{45} \left(\frac{1}{z^9}-\frac{1}{R_0^9}\right)
  \notag \\
  &+ \left( R_0 - z \right)\left(\frac{R_0^2}{2} +
  \frac{\sigma_W^6}{R_0^4} - \frac{2\sigma_W^{12}}{5R_0^{10}}\right)
  \notag \\
  &\hspace{2cm}+\frac{\sigma_W^6}{3}\left(\frac{1}{R_0^3}-\frac{1}{z^3}
  \right) \Bigg].
\label{eq:soft-wall-potential}
\end{align}
The distance $R_0$ is equal to a radius of a sphere which makes up the
wall plus the radius of a sphere in the fluid. Both $\epsilon$ and
$\sigma_W$ are Lennard-Jones parameters between the wall and the
fluid.

In Figure \ref{fig:soft-walls}, we compare our soft sphere DFT
against MC simulation and a BH fluid near a soft wall
with the potential given in Equation \ref{eq:soft-wall-potential}. We
plot the reduced density versus reduced distance from the surface of
the wall for $n^*=0.6$ at different temperatures. Again, the results
of our soft sphere fluid is as good as the BH fluid
overall.

  \caption{Soft walls plot, generated with new code generator.}
\label{fig:soft-walls}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Argon}

We compare our theory and BH data with experimental data for Argon. In
Figure~\ref{fig:argon-plots} we plot the radial distribution function
for three argon fluids~\cite{mikolaj2004structure,
  eggert2002quantitative, yarnell1973structure} and plot our soft
fluid theory, MC data, and a BH fluid about a Lenard-Jones test
particle. The Lennard-Jones parameters used for Argon are $\sigma = 3.405
~\textrm{\AA}$ and $\epsilon = 119.8$~K~\cite{verlet1967computer}. Our
theory shows a very good agreement with the BH fluid while both
overestimate density at contact.
\begin{figure*}

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, our theory is \fixme{pretty awesome}. The theory
presented in this paper is as good as a Barker-Henderson hard sphere
fluid for a range of densities and temperatures. The advantage of our
theory is that we can use it \emph{as is} rather than needing to
accomodate for discontinuities and delta functions of hard sphere
fluids.

\appendix

\section{Weighting functions in Fourier space}\label{sec:fourier}

We Fourier transform our weight functions to perform simulations in
Fourier space.  We find that
\begin{align}
  \tilde{w}_3(k) &= \frac{4\pi}{k} \int_0^\infty r w_3(r) \sin(kr) dr \\ 
  &= \frac{4\sqrt{\pi}}{k^3}\int_{-\sigma/2a}^\infty \left[
    \sin(k(au+\frac{\sigma}{2})) - k(au + \frac{\sigma}{2})
    \cos(k(au+\frac{\sigma}{2}))\right] e^{-u^2} du.
\end{align}
This is not an analytic function, but we assume that we are working at
low enough temperatures so that our function reduces to zero by $u=
-\frac{\sigma}{2a}$. We extend the lower limit to $-\infty$ then
\begin{align}
  \tilde{w}_3(k) &\approx
  \frac{4\pi}{k^3}e^{-\left(\frac{ak}{2}\right)^2}\left[ \left(1 +
    \frac{a^2k^2}{2} \right) \sin\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) -
    \frac{k}{2} \sigma\cos\left(\frac{k \sigma}{2}\right) \right]
\end{align}

We apply the same method to the other weight functions. These are
\begin{align}
  \tilde{w}_2(k) &=\frac{2\pi}{k} e^{-\left(\frac{ak}{2} \right)^2}
  \bigg(a^2 k \cos\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) \notag \\
  & \hspace{8em}+\sigma \sin\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) \bigg) \\ 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \tilde{w}_1(k) &=
  \frac{1}{k}e^{-\left(\frac{ak}{2} \right)^2}
  \sin\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) \\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \tilde{\mathbf{w}}_{2V}(\kk) &=
  \frac{i \pi}{k} e^{-\left(\frac{ak}{2} \right)^2}\bigg[ \left(\sigma^2 - a^4k^2\right)
    \cos\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) \notag\\ 
    & \hspace{5em}- 2\sigma \left(a^2k + \frac{1}{k}
    \right)\sin\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) \bigg]
  \mathbf{\hat{k}} \\ 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \mathbf{\tilde{w}}_{1V}(k)&= \frac{i}{k}
   e^{-\left(\frac{ak}{2} \right)^2} \bigg[ \frac{\sigma}{2}
    \cos\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) \notag\\
    & \hspace{6em}- \left( \frac{a^2k}{2} +
    \frac{1}{k} \right) \sin\left(\frac{k\sigma}{2}\right) \bigg]
  \mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{align}
$\tilde{w}_0(k)$ contains a $\frac{1}{r}$ term that expands the
integrand  as an infinite series. The first two terms were kept and
could be expressed in terms of $\tilde{w}_1(k)$ and
$\tilde{w}_2(k)$.
\begin{align}
  \tilde{w}_0(k) &= \frac{2}{\sigma} \left[2\tilde{w}_1(k) - \frac{1}{2 \pi
      \sigma}\tilde{w}_2(k) \right]
  \label{eq:w0-k}
\end{align}
This results in another approximation we must make. In real space we modify $n_0$ to agree with Equation~\ref{eq:w0-k}. So
\begin{align} 
 n_0(\rr) \approx \frac{2}{\alpha} \left[2 n_1(\rr) - \frac{1}{2
     \pi \alpha} n_2(\rr) \right]
\end{align}
