READ ME: Instructions on how to generate histograms showing the number of mean_n3 values in each bin range of relerror, and the final plot summarizing all the histogram data. Ideally, we want to see the relerror to be centered about 0, with 50% of the values below a relerror of 0 (in other words, 50% of the values should be negative).

1) Edit and run the script nm_hist.py from /deft/papers/fuzzy-fmt
   This generates the data for one histogram by running new-melting.cpp with specified gw, mc_constant, and number of seeds to run, and puts the data into a file. The command is:
	figs/new-melting.mkdat --kT 2 --n 1.3 --gw %g  --fv 0 --dx .5  --mc-error .001   --mc-constant %g --mc-prefactor 10000 --seed %g | tail -n 1   >> Hist_%g_10000_gw%g.dat
   Next, it runs the script Histogram.py which takes the data from Hist_%g_50000_gw%g.dat and creates a histogram. It also calculates the percent of relerror values that are negative and puts that information into a file called Hist.dat. The command is:
./Histogram.py Hist_%g_10000_gw%g.dat --gw %g --mcconstant %g --seeds %g >> Hist.dat

2)Edit and run the script nm_plot_histdata.py from /deft/papers/fuzzy-fmt
  This generates a scatter plot to compare histogram data. Each data point represents the result from one histogram: the percent_negative at an mc_constant for a given gw. Edit this script file for the num_lines in the Hist.dat file (this will be improved so it is done automatically), and title info for the plot. This script uses argparse with the name of the Hist.dat file as an input:
./nm_plot_histdata.py [filename.dat]
The plot is not automatically saved - must give the plot a name and save manually.

*See the file Hist_10000.dat for the particular values and git version of new-melting used to generated the data.
