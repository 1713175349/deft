Abstract = {{We develop a classical density functional for water which combines the
   White Bear fundamental-measure theory (FMT) functional for the hard
   sphere fluid with attractive interactions based on the statistical
   associating fluid theory variable range (SAFT-VR). This functional
   reproduces the properties of water at both long and short length scales
   over a wide range of temperatures and is computationally efficient,
   comparable to the cost of FMT itself. We demonstrate our functional by
   applying it to systems composed of two hard rods, four hard rods
   arranged in a square, and hard spheres in water. (C) 2013 American

Title = {{Application of a renormalization-group treatment to the statistical
   associating fluid theory for potentials of variable range (SAFT-VR)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{134}},

Abstract = {{An accurate prediction of phase behavior at conditions far and close to
   criticality cannot be accomplished by mean-field based theories that do
   not incorporate long-range density fluctuations. A treatment based on
   renormalization-group (RG) theory as developed by White and co-workers
   has proven to be very successful in improving the predictions of the
   critical region with different equations of state. The basis of the
   method is an iterative procedure to account for contributions to the
   free energy of density fluctuations of increasing wavelengths. The RG
   method has been combined with a number of versions of the statistical
   associating fluid theory (SAFT), by implementing White's earliest ideas
   with the improvements of Prausnitz and co-workers. Typically, this
   treatment involves two adjustable parameters: a cutoff wavelength L for
   density fluctuations and an average gradient of the wavelet function
   Phi. In this work, the SAFT-VR (variable range) equation of state is
   extended with a similar crossover treatment which, however, follows
   closely the most recent improvements introduced by White. The
   interpretation of White's latter developments allows us to establish a
   straightforward method which enables Phi to be evaluated; only the
   cutoff wavelength L then needs to be adjusted. The approach used here
   begins with an initial free energy incorporating only contributions from
   short-wavelength fluctuations, which are treated locally. The
   contribution from long-wavelength fluctuations is incorporated through
   an iterative procedure based on attractive interactions which
   incorporate the structure of the fluid following the ideas of
   perturbation theories and using a mapping that allows integration of the
   radial distribution function. Good agreement close and far from the
   critical region is obtained using a unique fitted parameter L that can
   be easily related to the range of the potential. In this way the
   thermodynamic properties of a square-well (SW) fluid are given by the
   same number of independent intermolecular model parameters as in the
   classical equation. Far from the critical region the approach provides
   the correct limiting behavior reducing to the classical equation
   (SAFT-VR). In the critical region the beta critical exponent is
   calculated and is found to take values close to the universal value. In
   SAFT-VR the free energy of an associating chain fluid is obtained
   following the thermodynamic perturbation theory of Wertheim from the
   knowledge of the free energy and radial distribution function of a
   reference monomer fluid. By determining L for SW fluids of varying well
   width a unique equation of state is obtained for chain and associating
   systems without further adjustment of critical parameters. We use
   computer simulation data of the phase behavior of chain and associating
   SW fluids to test the accuracy of the new equation. (C) 2011 American

Abstract = {{The statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) is now well established
   as an approach for the description of the thermodynamics and phase
   equilibria of a wide variety of fluid systems. Numerous SAFT studies of
   the fluid phase equilibria of pure water and aqueous mixtures have been
   made with the various incarnations of the theory, yet there is no
   consensus on what the `optimal' values of the intermolecular parameters
   are for water, or what the association scheme should be (two-, three-,
   or four-site models). We show that the conventional use of
   vapour-pressure and saturated-liquid-density data on their own leads to
   a degeneracy in the values of the parameters, particularly in the
   relative values of the dispersion and hydrogen-bonding energies. A
   discretized energy-parameter space is examined and a long valley of
   `optimal' parameter sets for the vapour-liquid equilibria is found for
   the various models, ranging from low dispersion (high hydrogen-bonding)
   to high dispersion (low hydrogen-bonding) energies. Other thermodynamic
   information such as the heat of vaporization does not allow one to
   discriminate between the values of the parameters or the association
   scheme. An examination of the degree of association (hydrogen bonding)
   allows such a discrimination to be made: the four-site model is found to
   provide the best overall description of the thermodynamics, fluid phase
   equilibria, and degree of association. The set of parameters obtained in
   this way also provides the best description of the fluid-phase
   equilibria for a mixture of water and methanol. This degeneracy of
   parameters could also be important when models of water are refined to
   vapour-liquid equilibria in simulation studies of aqueous systems, and
   for other systems of associating molecules.}},

Abstract = {{A version of the statistical associating: fluid theory (SAFT) is
   developed for chain molecules of hard-core segments with attractive
   potentials of variable range (SAFT-VR). The different contributions to
   the Helmholtz free energy are evaluated according to the Wertheim
   perturbation theory. The monomer properties are obtained from a
   high-temperature expansion up to second order, using a compact
   expression for the first-order perturbation term (mean-attractive
   energy) a(1). Making use of the mean-value theorem, a(1) is given as the
   van der Waals attractive constant and the Carnahan and Starling contact
   value for the hard-sphere radial distribution function in tens of an
   effective packing fraction. The second-order perturbation term a(2) is
   evaluated with the local compressibility approximation. The monomer
   cavity function, required for the calculation of the free energy due to
   the formation of the chains and the contribution due to association, is
   given as a function of a(1). We analyse the equation of state for chain
   molecules with three different types of monomer hard-core potentials
   with variable attractive range: square-well (SW). Yukawa (Y), and
   Sutherland (S). The theory for the hard-con potentials can easily be
   generalised to soft-core systems: we develop a simple equation of state
   for Mie m - n potentials, of which the Lennard-Jones (LJ) 6-12 potential
   is a particular case, The equations of state, expressed in terms of
   reduced variables, are explicit functions of the reduced temperature,
   the packing fraction, the number of monomers segments forming the chain,
   and the parameter lambda which characterises thr range of the the
   attractive potential. The relevance of the last parameter in the
   application of the theory to n-alkanes and n-perfluoroalkanes is
   explicitly shown with the SW expressions. An accurate description of the
   vapour pressure and the saturated Liquid densities is obtained, with a
   simple dependence of the parameters of the monomer potential on the
   number of carbons. The extension of our SAFT-VR expressions to mixtures
   is also presented in terms of a simple expression for the
   mean-attractive energy for mixtures, based on a straightforward
   generalisation of the theory for pure components. (C) 1997 American
