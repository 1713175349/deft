**Avoiding boundary effects in Wang-Landau sampling** *(accepted by PRE)*
This paper with DP Landau as an author considers a single system (the 2D Ising
model). The novelty of the paper is providing a scheme to avoid boundary effects
in WL. [10]

**Fast Calculation of the Density of States of a Fluid by Monte Carlo Simulations**
*(accepted by PRL)*
This paper compares two new methods with WL on the truncated Lennard-Jones system. [11]

**Optimizing the ensemble for equilibration in broad-histogram Monte Carlo simulations**
*(accepted by PRE)*
This paper presents an adaptive algorithm and compares with WL on 2D Ising systems. [12]

**Analysis of the convergence of the 1/t and Wang-Landau algorithms in the
calculation of multidimensional integrals** *(accepted by PRE)*
This paper compares the performance of two methods (WL and 1/t-WL) to calculate
different integrals (not a real physical system because the exact answer is
known). [15]

**Optimal modification factor and convergence of the Wang-Landau algorithm**
*(accepted by PRE)*
This paper examines the optimal modification factor for the WL algorithm and
tests on a single system (the 2D Ising model). [18]

**Convergence of Stochastic Approximation Monte Carlo and modified Wang–Landau
algorithms: Tests for the Ising model**
*(accepted by Computer Physics Communications)*
This paper compares SAMC, WL, and 1/t-WL on a single system (the 2D Ising model). [19]

**Stochastic approximation Monte Carlo and Wang–Landau Monte Carlo applied to a
continuum polymer model** *(accepted by Computer Physics Communications)*
SAMC and WL are compared for a single continuum model with a square well type
potential. [23]

**Direct calculation of liquid–vapor phase equilibria from transition
matrix Monte Carlo simulation** *J. Chem. Phys.*
This paper introduces a new method (adaptation of Fitzgerald et al.) TMMC and tests
on Lennard-Jones fluid. [35]

**Performance Limitations of Flat-Histogram Methods**
*(accepted by PRL)*
This paper examines optimal scaling of flat histogram methods on 2D Ising systems. [36]

**Flat Histogram Methods for Quantum Systems: Algorithms to Overcome Tunneling Problems
and Calculate the Free Energy**
*(accepted by PRL)*
This paper examines the generalization of WL algorithm on a spin-1/2 Heisenberg model. [37]

**Adaptive integration method for Monte Carlo simulations**
*(accepted by PRE)*
This paper introduces an adaptive sampling method and tests on Lennard-Jones. [38]

**Dynamically optimized Wang-Landau sampling with adaptive trial moves and
modification factors**
*(accepted by PRE)*
This paper introduces dynamically optimized WL sampling and tests on XY-Model. [39]
















There are many authors that acknowledge SAMC as a mathematical generalization of
WL. We list a few here in our response.

**Multidimensional stochastic approximation Monte Carlo**
*(accepted by PRE)*
"the Wang-Landau MC [3] scheme and its mathematical generalization, stochastic
approximation MC (SAMC) [4–6].""

**Convergence estimation of flat-histogram algorithms based on simulation results**
*(accepted by Computer Physics Communications)*
"At the same time, Liang suggested a generalized simulation method:stochastic
approximation Monte Carlo (SAMC) [7,8] including the 1/t-WL as a particular case"

**Stochastic approximation Monte Carlo and Wang–Landau Monte Carlo applied to a
continuum polymer model**
*(accepted by Computer Physics Communications)*
"Liang et al.[30] showed that WLMC could be seen as a version of SAMC and using
the mathematical background of stochastic approximation methods they proved the
convergence of SAMC."
