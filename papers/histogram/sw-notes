treat optimized ensemble separately
- plot OE figures separately (don't plot for now)
- inialize primary method, then initialize OE for ~10x longer

rerun goden calculations for N in [5..30] with ff=0.2
rerun all other data
run simulations with converged flat weights computed from golden transition matrices
 - (CFW simulation)
compare errors against CFW




optimized_ensemble changes
 - find df/dE by secant line in f(E)
   - secant line with 1/sqrt(e_hist[i]) up/down in f*e_hist[i]
   - average weights if we have an energy jump
 - run longer if df<0

fractional_sample_error: what should we do if samples=0?

IF we have a problem with picking bad minimum energies, consider requiring
  a minimum histogram count of exp(1/min_T) at the minimum energy
