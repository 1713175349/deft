treat optimized ensemble separately
- plot OE figures separately (don't plot for now)
- inialize primary method, then initialize OE for ~10x longer

rerun goden calculatoins for N in [5..30] with ff=0.2
rerun all other data
write code to read in weights from file and run simulation
run simulations with converged weights from golden calculations (CW simulation)
compare errors against CW




optimized_ensemble changes
 - find df/dE by secant line in f(E)
   - secant line with 1/sqrt(e_hist[i]) up/down in f*e_hist[i]
   - average weights if we have an energy jump
 - run longer if df<0

fractional_sample_error: what should we do if samples=0?

IF we have a problem with picking bad minimum energies, consider requiring
  a minimum histogram count of exp(1/min_T) at the minimum energy
