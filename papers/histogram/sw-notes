"canonical Monte Carlo" vs. "fixed-temperature Monte Carlo"?
is there any value to keeping the Gaussian approximation method around?


make optimistic min_samples a free parameter


talk about the similarity between optimized_ensemble and robustly_optimistic


optionally specify energy range for WL
 - flatten weights outside the energy range,
     but set them to canonical after initialization
optionally look for a minimum important energy to define the energy range
make sure we're not breaking wang_landau by not specifying a minimum energy


run long simulations for all methods to make sure they converge
 - for different temperatures
reference file instead of reference method


time limit for initialization?


run optimized_ensemble, tmmc, and robustly_optimistic for each end condition for many small N


clean up optimized_ensemble
 - find df/dE by secant line in f(E)
   - secant line with 1/sqrt(e_hist[i]) up/down in f*e_hist[i]
   - average weights if we have an energy jump


IF we have a problem with picking bad minimum energies, consider requiring
  a minimum histogram count of exp(1/min_T) at the minimum energy


make iterations vs initialization quality plot

include temp of max error in error file
error vs. temperature plot for U and CV

make wang_landau and tmmc dump weight aray and histogram periodically





run [vanilla_]wang_landau for 60, 80, 100, 150, 200
 - go from 100 to 200 by 20s?


after figuring out what to do with end conditions, run sims with large Ns and various min_Ts


change name of "canonical MC" to "infinite temperature MC" in thesis
