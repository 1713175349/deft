add seed = 9 data
run nw, wang landau, cfw simulations for N = 5..26 for all seeds

use other seeds in figures

print data periodically during initialization




treat optimized ensemble separately
- plot OE figures separately (don't plot for now)
- inialize primary method, then initialize OE for ~10x longer


fixed number of initialization iterations,
  but quit early if we satisfy a given end condition

optimized_ensemble changes
 - find df/dE by secant line in f(E)
   - secant line with 1/sqrt(e_hist[i]) up/down in f*e_hist[i]
   - average weights if we have an energy jump
 - run longer if df<0

fractional_sample_error: what should we do if samples=0?

IF we have a problem with picking bad minimum energies, consider requiring
  a minimum histogram count of exp(1/min_T) at the minimum energy
