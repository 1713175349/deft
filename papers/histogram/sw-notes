mean/max errors for various N
make optimized ensemble special


compare mean of max errors with different N and different seeds



optimized_ensemble changes
 - find df/dE by secant line in f(E)
   - secant line with 1/sqrt(e_hist[i]) up/down in f*e_hist[i]
   - average weights if we have an energy jump
 - run longer if df<0

fractional_sample_error: what should we do if samples=0?

IF we have a problem with picking bad minimum energies, consider requiring
  a minimum histogram count of exp(1/min_T) at the minimum energy
