remove convergence runs? they seem obsolete
simple_flat seems to be doing the best... comments?

optionally look for a minimum important energy to define the energy range
make sure we're not breaking wang_landau by not specifying a minimum energy

make iterations vs initialization quality plot

optimized_ensemble changes
 - find df/dE by secant line in f(E)
   - secant line with 1/sqrt(e_hist[i]) up/down in f*e_hist[i]
   - average weights if we have an energy jump
 - what does it mean if df < 0 ?

fractional_sample_error: what should we do if samples=0?
simple_flat and tmmc scaling (exp(1/min_T) instead of min_samples)


IF we have a problem with picking bad minimum energies, consider requiring
  a minimum histogram count of exp(1/min_T) at the minimum energy


run sims with large Ns and various min_Ts
