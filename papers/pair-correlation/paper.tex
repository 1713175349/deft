The pair distribution function is a key input into thermodynamic
perturbation theory, which is widely used for treating dispersion
interactions in fluids.  In most cases, the hard-sphere fluid is used
as the reference system, making the pair distribution function of the
hard-sphere system an important quantity.

Gil-Villegas\cite{gil1997statistical} approximates the first order inverse tenpurature Helmholtz Free energy term, which involves an integral of a potential multiplied by a radial distribution function $g^{HS}(r,\eta)$, by first taking the distribution function out of the integral and evaluating it at the correct mean distance $\zeta$, according to the mean value theorem.  They then approximate the pair correlation function $g^{HS}(\zeta,\eta)$ with the correlation at contact and at a effective $\eta_{eff}$.  The $\eta_{eff}$ is found by fitting a general function form to correct energy solutions $a_1$ with depenedent variable $\eta$ and

\section{THE END OF THE PAPER}

\section{Introduction}

Attard worked out the triplet correlation function, which is something
that we can access from the pair distribution function, if we consider
the pair correlation near a single hard sphere
solute\cite{attard1989spherically}.  Gonz\'alez \emph{et al} wrote an
interesting paper using DFT and Monte Carlo to compute the
three-particle distribution function (same as the triplet correlation
function)\cite{gonzalez1999test}.  Their theory compares favorably
with the ``superposition approximation'', and we could probably do
something similar.

Plischke and Henderson worked out the pair correlation function near a
hard wall using Percus-Yevick, and compare with Monte Carlo
results\cite{plischke1986pair}.  They plot the pair correlation
function along interesting paths.  \fixme{Jeff read this paper for a
  while and does not understand what they do in oder to find the pair
  correlation function as compared to the radial distribution function}

Lado recently introduced a new and improved efficient algorithm for
implementing integral equation theory for inhomogeneous fluids, which
computes $g^{(2)}(\rr_1,\rr_2)$ among other
things\cite{lado2009efficient}.  Lado's work looks pretty awkward to
use, and their example is limited to 1D systems.  And the scaling is
still (so far as I can tell) $O(N^2)$, since their improvement is in
the prefactor, by developing a nice basis set.

\section{Previous approaches}

Gloor \emph{et al} explain that little is known of the pair
distribution function of the hard-sphere fluid, and therefore use the
formula
\begin{align}
  g^{(2)}(\rr_1,\rr_2) \approx g\left(|\rr_1-\rr_2|, \frac{\rho(\rr_1)+\rho(\rr_2)}2\right)
\end{align}
They go on to further approximate the radial distribution function,
but we can just stop here.

Gloor et al \cite{gloor2007prediction} uses average density of two points:
\begin{align}
\overline{\rho} &\equiv \frac{\rho(\rr)+\rho(\rr')}{2}
\end{align}
and the uses bulk radial distribution for the reference system (hard
spheres) at this density, in order to approximate pair correlation.

Evans \cite{evans1992density}perscribes to use the same approximation but with an unspecified 'mean denisty':

\begin{align}
g^{(2)}(\rr_1,\rr_2) &\equiv g_r(\rho^m,\rr_{12})
\end{align}

Gross \cite{gross2009density} uses a hard chain reference fluid.  In
his functional he needs a pair correlation beween the different
segments of chains.  He approximates this function with the radial
distribution given by the Carnahan Starling at a density that is the
average density of the segment positions $\rr$ and $\rr'$:

\begin{align}
\overline{\rho} &\equiv \frac{\rho(\rr)+\rho(\rr')}{2}
\end{align}

Fu and Wu \cite{fu2005vapor} do I think the same as Gloor et al but maybe you (Dr. Roundy)
should take a look at it.  They reference Tang \cite{tang2008accurate} which I've
mentioned below in the Appendix.


Sokolowski and Fischer \cite{sokolowski1992role} do the same as Gloor et al except that instead of
taking the exact densities $\rho(\mathbf{r_1})$ and $\rho(\mathbf{r_2})$ to
average he takes an integral $\int_{V_{sphere}} \rho(\mathbf{r})d\mathbf{r}$
over a sphere of some radius centered at each point.  It's
these two averaged densities that he takes the average of.

Fischer and Methfessel \cite{fischer1980born}, in a paper that is cited by Sokolowski and Fischer (above) do the same thing (the originate the idea of the spherical average density.  Their Introduction has a very good discussion of the different averaging methods to get to $g(\mathbf{r})$ tried up until then (paper is written in 1980).

Fu and Wu \cite{fu2005vapor} do I think the same as Gloor et al but maybe you (Dr. Roundy)
should take a look at it.  They reference Tang \cite{tang2008accurate} which I've
mentioned below in the Appendix.

McCabe and Kiselev \cite{mccabe2004application} model a square well potential.  One of their terms uses a radial
distribution function that once again is taken to be the bulk function evaluated at an
effective density.  They reference a source that calculates this effective density (or filling fraction) to be
$\eta_{effective} = c_1\eta + c_2\eta^2 + c_3\eta^3$ where the coeffecients are gotten
from three coupled polynomial equations with $1,\lambda$, and $\lambda^2$, where $\lambda$
is a measure of the model's potential range.  They reference another source who calculates
the effective density in a similar (but more complicated) way.  I can look more at these
if you'd like.  They also use a different first order expansion formula for the ditribution
at contact in the chain term.


Toxvaerd \cite{toxvaerd1976hydrostatic}approximates the radial distribution as the radial distribution
of the bulk at the same density.  Uses the first two terms in a tempurature
expansion.  First term is just Carnahan Starling derived, second is empirical.


\section{Pair distribution function with inhomogeneity}

The pair distribution function can be defined using the two particle
density as
\begin{align}
  g^{(2)}(\rr_1,\rr_2) &\equiv \frac{n^{(2)}(\rr_1,\rr_2)}{n(\rr_1)n(\rr_2)}
\end{align}

We may also want to consider the \emph{triplet} distribution function
\begin{align}
  g^{(3)}(\rr_1,\rr_2,\rr_3) &\equiv \frac{n^{(3)}(\rr_1,\rr_2,\rr_3)}{n(\rr_1)n(\rr_2)n(\rr_3)}
\end{align}
The triplet distribution is relevant, because we can compute the
triplet distribution of the homogeneous system by considering the
\emph{pair} distribution of the inhomogeneous ``test-particle
scenario.''  The process is that we solve the inhomogeneous situation
in which we have one hard sphere located at the origin.  We solve for
the density around that hard sphere, and this gives us the pair
distribution function of the homogeneous system $g^{(2)}(0, \rr)$.
When we solve for the pair distribution $g^{(2)}(\rr_1,\rr_2)$ of the
inhomogeneous system, this will give us the \emph{triplet}
distribution function of the homogeneous system
$g^{(3)}(0,\rr_1,\rr_2)$.

\section{Goals of this paper (to be integrated into rest of paper)}


In this paper, we seek an efficient approximation for the pair
correlation function of an inhomogeneous hard-sphere fluid, where we
define efficient as an algorithm that scales as $O(N\log N)$ where $N$
scales as the volume of the system under consideration.
Integral equation theory (look this up) scales as $O(N^2)$, which can
be very expensive for large three-dimensional systems.

Fundamental-Measure Theory (FMT) is constructed using only single-point
convolutions (check terminology) such as
\begin{align}
  n_\alpha(\rr) &= \int n(\rr')w_\alpha(|\rr-\rr'|) d\rr'
\end{align}
These convolutions can be computed in Fourier space in $O(N\log N)$
time, with the result that the FMT free energy---and its
gradient---can be computed in $O(N\log N)$ time.

The pair distribution function is used in computing the first term in
the high-temperature perturbation expansion, which is used in SAFT
(for instance) to treat dispersion interactions.  This term is written
as
\begin{align}\label{eq:a1}
  a_1 &\propto \iint n(\rr)n(\rr') \Phi(|\rr-\rr'|)
  g^{(2)}(\rr,\rr')d\rr d\rr'
\end{align}
where $\Phi(r)$ is the pair potential.  If $g^{(2)}(\rr,\rr')$ could
be written as $g(|\rr-\rr'|)$, this term could be computed in $O(N\log
N)$ time.  However, this is not possible when the density is
inhomogeneous, because the pair distribution function depends on the
density.

In this paper, we consider a superposition approximation, in which
construct an approximate representation for the pair distribution
function, which allows the first term in the high temperature
expansion given in Equation~\ref{eq:a1} to be computed in $O(N\log N)$
time.  One input to this approach is our recently published expression
for an average of the value of the pair distribution function at
contact $g_\sigma(\rr)$, which itself can be computed in $O(N\log N)$
time.

\begin{dmath}
  g^{(2)}(\rr_1,\rr_2) = \frac{g(|r_{12}|, \eta(g_\sigma(\rr_1))) + g(|r_{12}|, \eta(g_\sigma(\rr_2)))}{2}
\end{dmath}
Bad:
\begin{dmath}
  g^{(2)}(\rr_1,\rr_2) = g\left(|r_{12}|, \frac{\eta(g_\sigma(\rr_1)) + \eta(g_\sigma(\rr_2))}{2}\right)
\end{dmath}

The general idea is to write
\begin{dmath}
  g^{(2)}(\rr_1,\rr_2) = \Theta(r_{12}-\sigma)
  \left(1 + \sum_{\alpha} \frac{f_{\alpha}(g_\sigma(\rr_1)) + f_{\alpha}(g_\sigma(\rr_2))}{2}g_{\alpha}(r_{12})\right)\label{eq:gpair-approx}
\end{dmath}
where $f_{\alpha}$ and $g_{\alpha}$ are a set of functions that
satisfy the following constraint:
\begin{dmath}\label{eq:definealpha}
  \sum_{\alpha} f_{\alpha}(g_\sigma(\eta)) g_{\alpha}(r) \approx g(r; \eta)
\end{dmath}
which ensures that our pair distribution function reduces
(approximately) to the radial distribution function in the homogeneous
limit.  Equation~\ref{eq:gpair-approx} is constructed such that
Equation~\ref{eq:a1} can be evaluated in $O(N\log N)$ time, since all
the required convolutions may be performed with a fixed kernel.

Our proposed pair distribution function has several good properties.
When evaluated at contact ($r_{12}=\sigma$), it gives the same good
result as our previously-published functional for the averaged pair
distribution function at contact, which is constructed to give an
accurate prediction for the contribution to Equation~\ref{eq:a1} from
spheres in contact.  In the homogeneous limit,
Equation~\ref{eq:gpqair-approx} should give a prediction that is as
accurate as the approximate equality in
Equation~\ref{eq:definealpha}.  In inhomogeneous distributions and at
intermediate distances, we expect our pair distribution function to be
least accurate, but one hopes that it will be reasonable, simply
because it is an average of two reasonable results.


\subsection*{Fundamental-Measure Theory}

We use the White Bear version of the Fundamental-Measure Theory~(FMT)
functional~\cite{roth2002whitebear}, which describes the excess free
energy of a hard-sphere fluid.  The White Bear functional reduces to
the Carnahan-Starling equation of state for homogeneous systems.  It
is written as an integral over all space of a local function of a set
of ``fundamental measures'' $n_\alpha(\rr)$, each of which is written
as a one-center convolution of the density.  The White Bear free
energy is thus
\begin{equation}
A_{\textit{HS}}[n] = k_B T \int \left(\Phi_1(\rr) + \Phi_2(\rr) + \Phi_3(\rr)\right) d\rr \; ,
\end{equation}
with integrands
\begin{align}
\Phi_1 &= -n_0 \ln\left( 1 - n_3\right) \label{eq:Phi1}\\
\Phi_2 &= \frac{n_1 n_2 - \mathbf{n}_{V1} \cdot\mathbf{n}_{V2}}{1-n_3} \\
\Phi_3 &= (n_2^3 - 3 n_2 \mathbf{n}_{V2} \cdot \mathbf{n}_{V2}) \frac{
  n_3 + (1-n_3)^2 \ln(1-n_3)
}{
  36\pi n_3^2\left( 1 - n_3 \right)^2
} , \label{eq:Phi3}
\end{align}
using the fundamental measures
\begin{align}
  n_3(\rr) &= \int n(\rr') \Theta(\sigma/2 -\left|\rr - \rr'\right|)
  d\rr' \label{eq:FMn3} \\
  n_2(\rr) &= \int n(\rr') \delta(\sigma/2 -\left|\rr - \rr'\right|) d\rr' \\
  \mathbf{n}_{2V}(\rr) &= \int n(\rr') \delta(\sigma/2 -\left|\rr - \rr'\right|) \frac{\rr-\rr'}{|\rr-\rr'|}d\rr'
\end{align}
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{n}_{V1} = \frac{\mathbf{n}_{V2}}{2\pi \sigma}, \quad
  n_1 &= \frac{n_2}{2\pi \sigma} , \quad
  n_0 = \frac{n_2}{\pi \sigma^2} \label{eq:FMrest}
\end{align}

\appendix

\section*{Appendix}
\cite{jin2011perturbative} Combines hard sphere (white bear) with attraction that is not mean field but rather uses two other correltation expressions given in  -\cite{tang2008accurate} and \cite{hlushak2009direct}

Tang \cite{tang2008accurate}Derives the direct correltation for a SW and Yukawa and LJ potentials by first getting the radial distribution function through a method I don't really understand.  Composes fourier transforms $c(k)$ and $h(k)$ of these complicated functions that depend on filling fraction and the potential in an integral. Uses first order mean spherical approximation.  This is just square potential well around particle but the radial distribution function takes only the first order in an expansion in... (high temp?).

\cite{hlushak2009direct}
Cites \cite{tang2008accurate} (above) and does largely the same thing but then adds a complication for $2 < \lambda \leq 3$

\cite{levesque2012scalar}
Uses direct correlation funtion that's gotten from a radial distribution function of a homogeneous density.  The direct correlation itself is only dependent on distance.  The $\rho_0$ that they use is the same $\rho_0$ that the used in the reference HS term in their functional.  The use the Carnahan Starling or the Perkis Yevick for these hard sphere free energies.  The other terms involve $\delta\rho$ so the change is a variation from the reference density.  They further modify it by looking at molecular dynamic simulations of a certain model of water molecules and looking at the oxygen-oxygen correlation.
