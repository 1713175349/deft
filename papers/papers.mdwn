The `papers/` directory
=======================

This is where we have the latex code and code to generate the figures
that will produce papers that are describe deft and the methods it
implements.


Each paper is in a subdirectory, which contains all the code required
to create the paper.  These subdirectories are themselves listed in
`papers/GNUmakefile`.

Within each paper directory is a `GNUmakefile` that controls the
building of the paper itself.  There is a `figs/` subdirectory, which
contains all the code (and data) required to generate the figures for
that paper.
