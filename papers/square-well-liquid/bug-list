minimum energies seen in debugging, etc.:
  N = 10, E = 33
  N = 20, E = 97

wang landau:

stuck during initialization if it finds a low energy exceedingly difficult to find again,
  (the count variation becomes huge, and stays such)
stuck in sw.initialize_max_entropy_and_translation_distance() right after initialization,
  due to finding an energy which it did not see during initialization
  (the weights at such energies are absurdly huge)

walker optimization:

results can depend on the scale of the gaussian pre-initialization
