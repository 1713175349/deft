implement flat end condition
implement tmmc end condition (into modular end conditions)
implement partial canonical weights if sample error end condition is used
  - limit slope of weight array at lowest energies, extend to unseen energies

run simns with various end conditions, parameters, and (small) N combinations
run sims with reasonable parameter and end conditions with large Ns and various min_Ts

determine metric for quality of initializations
 - max error in U/Nk or C_V/nK at T \ge min_T

make iterations vs initialization quality plot

change name of "canonical MC" to "infinite temperature MC" in thesis

check which methods rely on the gaussian pre-initialization
