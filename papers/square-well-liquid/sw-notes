the choice of Tmin currently seems to determine the best histogram method.
  for high (>= 0.45) Tmin, walker optimization does best, but only slightly
  for low (< 0.45) Tmin, wang landau does best, and is comparable to tmmc;
    walker optimization and robustly opitmistic are terrible with low Tmin
the best overall performance seems to be with wang landau at Tmin ~= 0.2


gaussian pre-initialization makes a substantial difference for the performance of the
  walker optimization method (with Tmin = 0.45), but appears to have little to no effect
  on other methods

making the end condition for walker optimization more stringent by requiring 3 (instead of
  only 2) minimum energy samples considerably worsens its performance, which is very strange

the bubble suppression sometimes (e.g. with Tmin = 0.45) does worse than just the
  gaussian method. this result is strange, but probably not worthwhile looking into
