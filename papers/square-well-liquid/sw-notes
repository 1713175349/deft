figure out why fractional_sample_error requires samples[i]+1
 - it shouldn't!

run [vanilla_]wang_landau for 60, 80, 100, 150, 200
 - go from 100 to 200 by 20s?


(?)implement current tmmc end condition into modular end conditions
 - i.e. use slope of dos to determine minimum energy for optimistic min_samples

four separate end conditions: optimistic/pessimistic min_samples/sample_error
 - all min_samples can use slope of dos to determine the minimum energy we care about
 - combine end conditions in one initialization routine?
   - e.g. a sample error of x with y init_samples

using min_T_energy for keeping track of walkers in optimized_ensemble as well

thoughts on the fact that robustly_optimistic used to work well with a flatness end condition
  and just pushing down weights?

scaling between algorithm iterations in tmmc vs in robustly_optimistic
 - if they are made to scale the same way, the two methods would only differ by
    whether they use the transition matrix in move_a_ball (remembering that end conditions are
    decoupled from histogram methods)

check which methods rely on the gaussian pre-initialization




run optimized_ensemble, tmmc, and robustly_optimistic for each end condition for many small N

after figuring out what to do with end conditions, run sims with large Ns and various min_Ts


determine metric for quality of initializations
 - max error in U/Nk or C_V/nK at T \ge min_T

make iterations vs initialization quality plot

change name of "canonical MC" to "infinite temperature MC" in thesis
