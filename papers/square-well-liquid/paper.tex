\maketitle

The SAFT Helmholtz free energy is composed of five terms:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:SAFT-free-energy}
  F = F_\textit{id} + F_\textit{hs} + F_\textit{disp} +
  F_\textit{assoc} + F_\textit{chain},
\end{equation}
where the first three terms---ideal gas, hard-sphere repulsion and
dispersion---encompass the \emph{monomer} contribution
to the free energy, the fourth is the \emph{association} free energy,
describing hydrogen bonds, and the final term is the chain formation
energy for fluids that are chain polymers.  While a
number of formulations of SAFT have been published, we will focus on
SAFT-VR\cite{gil-villegas-1997-SAFT-VR}.

\section{Theory}

\subsection{Thermodynamic perturbation theory}

\fixme{Add here an introduction to thermodyamic perturbation theory,
  explaining $a_1$ and $a_2$ and their ``exact'' formulas that we wish
  to approximate.}



\subsection{Square well contribution in homogeneous case}
The square well contribution to the free energy is based on
thermodynamic perturbation theory (sometimes known as the ``high
temperature expansion'').  We use a dispersion term based on the
SAFT-VR approach\cite{gil-villegas-1997-SAFT-VR}, which has two
parameters an interaction energy $\epsilondisp$ and a length scale
$\lambdadisp R$.

The SAFT-VR dispersion free energy has the form~\cite{gil-villegas-1997-SAFT-VR}
\begin{align}
  F_\text{disp}[n] &= \int \left(a_1(\xx) + \beta a_2(\xx)\right)n(\xx)d\xx,
\end{align}
where $a_1$ and $a_2$ are the first two terms in a high-temperature
perturbation expansion and $\beta=1/k_BT$.  The first term, $a_1$, is 
the mean-field dispersion interaction. The second term, $a_2$, describes the
effect of fluctuations resulting from compression of the fluid due
to the dispersion interaction itself, and is approximated
using the local compressibility approximation (LCA), which
assumes the energy fluctuation is simply related to the
compressibility of a hard-sphere reference fluid\cite{barker1976liquid}.

\fixme{Add here a complete exposition of this functional form,
  reproducing what Gil Villegas says.}

\subsection{A simple weighted density approach}

Hughes \emph{et al.} used a simple weighted density approach to
approximate the square-well contribution to the free energy, which we
will describe here~\cite{hughes2013classical}.

The form of $a_1$ and $a_2$ for SAFT-VR is given in
reference~\cite{gil-villegas-1997-SAFT-VR}, expressed in terms
of the packing fraction.  In order to apply this form to an
\emph{inhomogeneous} density distribution, we construct an effective local
packing fraction for dispersion $\etadisp$, given by a Gaussian
convolution of the density:
\begin{align}
%    ((4/3.0*M_PI)*Pow(3)(R)*GaussianConvolve(2*lambdainput*lscale*radius,
%                                             2*lambdaE*length_scalingE*Rexpr)
%  \etadisp(\xx) &= \color{red}
%  \int \frac{\Theta(2\lambdadisp\lscale R - \left|\xx-\xx'\right|)}{
%             \left(2\lambdadisp\lscale\right)^3} n(\xx') d\xx'.
  \etadisp(\xx) &= \frac{1}{6\sqrt{\pi} \lambdadisp^3\lscale^3}
  \int n(\xx')\exp\left({-\frac{|\xx-\xx'|^2}{2(2 \lambdadisp
      \lscale R)^2}}\right)d\xx'.
\end{align}
This effective packing fraction is used throughout the dispersion
functional, and represents a packing fraction averaged over the
effective range of the dispersive interaction.  Here we have
introduced an additional empirical parameter $\lscale$ which modifies
the length scale over which the dispersion interaction is correlated.

\fixme{Check out what other groups have done, especially Jackson
  and/or Gross.  Also Arias.}

\subsection{Weighted density approach}

\cite{peng2008meanfield} used by
\cite{sundararaman2013efficient} and many others.

See also \cite{yu2009novel} which explicitly addresses the square well
liquid.

Also look up \cite{shen2013hybrid} which might follow Yu above.

\subsection{The contact value approximation for the hard-sphere pair distribution function}

We have recently introduced an efficient approximation for the pair
distribution function of the inhomogeneous hard-sphere fluid.  This
approximation takes the form:
\begin{align}
  g^{(2)}(\rr_1,\rr_2) = \frac{g_S(r_{12}, g_\sigma(\rr_1)) +
    g_S(r_{12}, g_\sigma(\rr_2))}{2} \label{eq:g2-our-mean}
\end{align}
where $g_S(r,g_\sigma)$ is a separable fit to the radial distribution
function of the homogeneus hard-sphere fluid, and $g_\sigma(\rr)$ is
an approximation for the pair distribution function of an
inhomogeneous hard-sphere fluid averaged over contact with a sphere
located at position $\rr$.

\subsubsection{Separable radial distribution function
  $g_S(r,g_\sigma)$}

The separable radial distribution function $g_S(r,g_\sigma)$ is given
by
\newcommand\kappaO{\kappa_0}
\newcommand\kappaI{\kappa_1}
\newcommand\kappaZ{\kappa_2}
\newcommand\kappazero{3.68}
\newcommand\kappaone{2.16}
\newcommand\kappatwo{2.79}

\begin{multline}
  g_S(r,g_\sigma) = 1 + (g_\sigma-1) e^{-\kappaO \left(\frac{r}{\sigma}-1\right)} \\
  + (g_\sigma -1)(\kappaO - 2g_\sigma)  \left(\frac{r}{\sigma}-1\right)e^{-\kappaI  \left(\frac{r}{\sigma}-1\right)} \\
  + I(g_\sigma)  \left(\frac{r}{\sigma}-1\right)^2e^{-\kappaZ  \left(\frac{r}{\sigma}-1\right)}
\end{multline}
\begin{equation}
  I(g_\sigma) = \kappaZ^5 \frac{
    \frac{\chi-1}{24\eta} + (1-g_\sigma) \frac{(\kappaO-2
      g_\sigma)(\kappaI^2 + 4 \kappaI + 6)}{\kappaI^4}
    + (1-g_\sigma)\frac{\kappaO^2 + 2\kappaO + 2}{\kappaO}
  }{2 \kappaZ^2 + 12 \kappaZ + 24}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \chi = \frac{(1-\eta)^4}{\eta^4 - 4\eta^3 + 4\eta^2 + 4\eta + 1}
\end{equation}
Finally, we can convert between the packing fraction $\eta$ and the
radial distribution function at contact $g_\sigma$ using the
Carnahan-Starling approximation for $g_\sigma$:
\newcommand\nastyetacuberoot{\sqrt[3]{54 g_\sigma^2 -
    6\sqrt{81g_\sigma^4 - 6g_\sigma^3}}}
\begin{align}
  g_\sigma &= \frac{1-\tfrac{\eta}{2}}{(1-\eta)^3}\text{, and its inverse} \\
  \eta &= 1 - \frac{1}{\nastyetacuberoot} - \frac{\nastyetacuberoot}{6g_\sigma}.
\end{align}
This function includes three fitted parameters, $\kappaO =
\kappazero$, $\kappaI = \kappaone$,
and $\kappaZ = \kappatwo$.
