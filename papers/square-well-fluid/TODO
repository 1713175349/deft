Debugging what is wrong:

1. Attempt test-particle computation (maybe with no potential?) and
   find out what we saw went wrong before.  Then debug that.

2. Look up (or find analytically) the k=0 limit of weighting
   functions, and implement the homogeneous functional in python.
   Compare with the C++ generated values, in case we have a bug in the
   generated code.

3. Look into getting the second-order correction with local
   compressibility approximation.  (Maybe this will fix the
   coexistence curve?)  Could test this out with the python code from
   #2.

To run several homogeneous MC simulatinos:

for tff in `seq 1 6`; do python data/run-mc-homogeneous.py 1.3 0.$tff 500 0.1 1e9; done

To generate animations from the above simulations:

for tff in `seq 1 6`; do echo 0.$tff; time python figs/animate-homogeneous.py 1.3 0.$tff 500; done
