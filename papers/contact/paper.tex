  in Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT), which is the basis
  of a number of recent classical density functionals.  We derive a

There has been considerable recent interest in using Statistical
Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) to construct classical density
functionals to describe associating
fluids\cite{\saftlocaldft,\saftnonlocaldft}.  This approach has been
successful in qualitatively describing the dependence of surface
tension on temperature.  Unfortunately, most of these constructed
functionals\cite{\saftlocaldft} cannot be used to study arbitrary
inhomogeneous density distributions, because they use local density
approximations that are only valid for densities that vary slowly over
molecular length scales.  A key input to those SAFT-based functionals
that can handle sharply varying densities is the correlation function
evaluated at contact.

Constructing a classical density functional based on SAFT involves
rewriting each term in the free energy as a functional of an
inhomogeneous density.  The SAFT free energy consists of four terms:
\begin{align}
  A_\textit{SAFT} &= A_\textit{ideal} + A_\textit{HS} + A_\textit{chain} + A_\textit{disp} + A_\textit{assoc}
\end{align}
where $A_\textit{ideal}$ is the ideal-gas free energy, $A_\textit{HS}$
is the excess free energy of a hard-sphere fluid of monomers,
$A_\textit{chain}$ is the contribution to the free energy from the
chaining effect in a polymeric fluid, $A_\textit{disp}$ is the
dispersion contribution to the free energy, and $A_\textit{assoc}$ is
the free energy contribution from \emph{association}, which is to say,
hydrogen bonding.  The chain and association contributions to the SAFT
free energy are of particular interest for this paper, since each uses
as input the contact value of the correlation function.
%
Yu and Wu introduced in 2002 a functional for the association term of
the free energy, which included a functional for the contact value of
the correlation function (see
Section~\ref{sec:yuwu})\cite{yu2002fmt-dft-inhomogeneous-associating},
which has subsequently been used in other
functionals\cite{fu2005vapor-liquid-dft, bryk2006density}.
%% Each of these terms has some dependence on the
%% inhomogeneity in the density.  The ideal gas is purely local, and in
%% fact must be the only purely local term in the free energy in order
%% for the functional to satisfy the contact-value theorem.  The
%% hard-sphere contribution contribution to the free energy has been
%% thoroughly studied, and is well approximated by the White Bear version
%% of the Fundamental-Measure Theory (FMT)
%% functional\cite{roth2002whitebear}.
Two functionals for the chain contribution have recently been
introduced\cite{bryk2006density, gross2009density}, one which uses the
contact value of the correlation function of Yu and
Wu\cite{bryk2006density}, while the other introduces a new functional
for the contact value of the correlation
function (see Section~\ref{sec:gross})\cite{gross2009density}.
%% The dispersion term is long-range and thus has significant
%% dependence on the density distribution, but because its relatively
%% weak position dependence, is amenable to mean-field approximations.
Given these different approaches, it seems worthwhile to examine this
property of the hard-sphere fluid through direct simulation, in order
to establish the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

We first discuss two possibilities for the definition of contact
density.  The first involves a more symmetric interpretation and so we
call it the '$S$ case'.  The second involves a sphere-centered,
assymetrical interpretation and so we call it the '$A$ case'.  We
present where in the SAFT free energy formulation these contact
densities will contribute.  We next present a thermodynamic method
that we will use to calculate the above contact densities.  This
method involves the use of surface pressure and the minimization of
the excess free energy refered to above.  We use the White Bear and
White Bear Mark II formulations of these free energy terms and take
neccesary derivitives in the concpetual spirit of the seperately
defined $S$ an $A$ case contact densities.  Finally we compare the
resulting contact densities with those of Gross, those of Yu and Wu,
and as well with our own Monte Carlo simulations.


\section{Correlation function with inhomogeneity}

We will define our terms by making use of the two-particle density
$n^{(2)}(\rr_1,\rr_2)$, which gives the probability per unit volume of
finding one particle at position $\rr_1$ and the other at position
$\rr_2$.  The pair correlation function is defined by
\begin{align}
  g(\rr_1,\rr_2) &\equiv \frac{n^{(2)}(\rr_1,\rr_2)}{n(\rr_1)n(\rr_2)}
\end{align}
In a homogeneous fluid, the pair correlation only depends on the
distance $|\rr_1-\rr_2|$, and can be expressed as a function of a
single variable, with the contact value being when that distance is
the diameter $\sigma$.  It is desirable for reasons of efficiency to limit CDFT
functionals to one-center convolutions, which leads us to seek a
simplified expression for the contact value of the correlation
function---which is the same as the contact value of the cavity
correlation function for hard spheres.
In a system with an inhomogeneous density, we seek a \emph{local}
value for $g_\sigma$.  There are two reasonable options for defining
such a local function: a symmetric formulation (which we refer to as $S$) and an
asymmetric formulation (which we refer to as $A$).

For the symmetric $S$ case:
\begin{align}
  g^S_\sigma(\rr) &= \frac{1}{n_0(\rr)^2}\int n^{(2)}(\rr - \rr', \rr
  + \rr')
  \frac{\delta(|\rr'| -\sigma/2)}{\pi\sigma^2}d\rr' \\
  n_0(\rr) &= \int n(\rr')\frac{\delta(|\rr-\rr'|-\sigma/2)}{\pi\sigma^2} d\rr'
\end{align}
This functional gives a value averaged over spheres that touch at the
position $\rr$.  The density $n_0$ is one of the fundamental measures
of Fundamental Measure Theory (FMT), and seems ideal for treating
touching spheres.

And for the asymmetric $A$ case:
\begin{align}
  g^A_\sigma(\rr) &= \frac{1}{n(\rr)n_A(\rr)}
  \int n^{(2)}(\rr, \rr + \rr')
  \frac{\delta(|\rr'| - \sigma)}{4\pi\sigma^2}d\rr' \\
  n_A(\rr) &= \int n(\rr')
  \frac{\delta(|\rr-\rr'|-\sigma)}{4\pi\sigma^2} d\rr'
\end{align}
In this case, the two-particle density is averaged over spheres
touching a sphere that is aat the given position $\rr$.

In the process of defining these two averaged correlation functions,
we also defined two averaged densities, $n_0(\rr)$ and $n_A(\rr)$,
which are the density of spheres available to be in
contact.  In the homogeneous limit, $n_0 = n_A = n$.  It is an
open question, which of these averages will be more useful in any
particular functional.  Suffice to say, either average is a
\emph{possible} way to convert a function that is defined for a
homogeneous system to a functional that is applicable to inhomogeneous
systems.

Yu and Wu introduce an approximation for
$g^S$\cite{yu2002fmt-dft-inhomogeneous-associating}, which we will
discus in Section~\ref{sec:yuwu}.  Gross introduced an
approximation for $g^A$\cite{gross2009density}, which we will
introduce in Section~\ref{sec:gross}.  We will also introduce our own
approximations for both $g^A$ and $g^S$ which are based on the
assumption of thermodynamic consistency within FMT, in
Sections~\ref{sec:g-S} and~\ref{sec:g-A}.  We will report on the accuracy of
these approximations by comparing with Monte Carlo simulations of the
inhomogeneous hard-sphere fluid.  We will focus on the contact
densities, rather than the correlation function itself, because these
are simpler, and because they are the quantity that you want to
``average''.  i.e. if you were to average $g$ itself, you'd want to
weight that average based on the density, which would mean averaging
$n^{(2)}$.


\subsection{Association free energy of SAFT}

\fixme{Integrate the following equations into this section...}
\begin{align}
  \frac{A_\textit{chain}}{kT} &= -(m-1) n \left(\ln\left(n g_\sigma \right)-1\right)
\end{align}
\begin{align}
  \frac{A_\textit{assoc}}{kT} &= \sum_i n \left(\ln X_i - \frac12 X_i + \frac12\right) \\
  X_i &= \frac{1}{1 + \sum_j n g_\sigma X_j\kappa_{ij} \left(e^{\beta \epsilon_{ij}}-1\right)}
\end{align}

\newcommand\epsilonassoc{\ensuremath{\varepsilon_\textit{AB}}}
\newcommand\kappaassoc{\ensuremath{\kappa_\textit{AB}}}
\newcommand\ncontact{\ensuremath{n_\textit{contact}}}

The free energy term in Statistical Associating Fluid Teory (SAFT)
from which it derives its name is the association term, which accounts
for hydrogen bonding.  Hydrogen bonds are modeled as attractive
patches (``association sites'') on the surface of hard spheres.  These
sites represent protons or electron lone pairs, and have an attractive
energy $\epsilonassoc$ when two molecules are oriented such that the
proton of one overlaps with the lone pair of the other.  The volume
over which this interaction occurs is $\kappaassoc$, giving the
association term in the free energy has two empirical parameters fit
to experimental data.

The association free energy per unit volume has the form
\begin{align}
  f_\text{assoc} &= k_BT n\sum_A 
                  \left(\ln X^A - \frac{X^A}{2} + \frac12\right)
\end{align}
where the summation is over the association sites, and $X^A$ is the
fraction of association sites \emph{not} hydrogen-bonded.  The
fractions $X^A$ are determined by the self-consistent equations
\begin{align}
  X^A &= \frac{1}
  {1 + \sum_B n X^B \Delta^{AB}}\label{eq:X}
  \\
  \Delta^{AB} &= g(\sigma) \kappaassoc\left( e^{\epsilonassoc/kT} -
  1 \right)\label{eq:delta}
\end{align}
where $g(\sigma)$ is the correlation function evaluated at contact.
The product of density with correlation function evaluated at contact
gives the contact density, when we combine Equations~\ref{eq:X} and
\ref{eq:delta}:
\begin{align}
  X^A &= \frac{1}
  {1 + \sum_B \ncontact\kappaassoc X^B\left( e^{\epsilonassoc/kT} -
  1 \right)}
\end{align}
where the product $\ncontact\kappaassoc$ is the expected number of
molecules present in the association volume in the absence of the
association interaction.  In the SAFT-VR
model\cite{gil-villegas-1997-SAFT-VR}, this contact density is found
by adding a perturbative correction to the contact value for a hard
sphere fluid.

\subsection{Homogeneous limit}

In order to motivate the derivation of our functional for contact
density, we begin by deriving the well-known contact density for a
homogeneous hard-sphere fluid from the Carnahan-Starling free energy.
The contact density is most easily computed from the contact density
theorem, which states that the pressure on any hard surface is
determined by the density at contact:
\begin{align}
  p &= k_BT n_\textit{contact}.
\end{align}
Since we are interested in the contact density at the surface of the
hard spheres, all we need compute is the pressure on that surface, and
we'll have our answer.  The pressure on a hard sphere can be readily
computed from the dependence of the Carnahan-Starling free energy on
hard sphere radius.
\begin{align}
  A_{HS} &= Nk_BT \frac{4\eta - 3\eta^2}{(1-\eta)^2}
\end{align}
where $\eta \equiv \frac{4\pi}{3} R^3 n$ is the filling fraction.  We
can thus readily compute the derivative of free energy with respect to
hard-sphere radius:
\begin{align}
  \frac{dA_{HS}}{dR} &= \frac{dA_{HS}}{d\eta} \frac{d\eta}{dR} \\
  \derivation{
    &= Nk_BT \left( \frac{4 - 6\eta}{(1-\eta)^2} + 2 \frac{4\eta - 3\eta^2}{(1-\eta)^3} \right) \frac{d\eta}{dR}
    \\
    &= Nk_BT \frac{4 - 4\eta - 6\eta + 6\eta^2 + 8\eta - 6\eta^2}{(1-\eta)^3} \frac{d\eta}{dR}
    \\
    &= Nk_BT \frac{4 - 2\eta}{(1-\eta)^3} \frac{d\eta}{dR}
    \\
  }
  &= Nk_BT \frac{4 - 2\eta}{(1-\eta)^3} \frac{3 \eta}{R} \label{eq:dAhsdR}
\end{align}
This derivative gives us the force on \emph{all} the hard
spheres---since we're changing all their radii at once.  To compute
the pressure on the spheres, we just need to divide by the total area,
which means dividing by $N 4\pi \sigma^2$, since the relevant area
is the area over which the molecules can make contact.
\begin{align}
  p_{HS} &= \frac{1}{N 4\pi \sigma^2} \frac{dA_{HS}}{dR} \\
  \derivation{
    &= \frac14 \frac{1}{N 4\pi R^2} Nk_BT \frac{4 - 2\eta}{(1-\eta)^3} \frac{3 \eta}{R} \\
    &= \frac{3}{4\pi R^3} \eta k_BT \frac{1 -
      \frac{\eta}2}{(1-\eta)^3} \\
  }
  &= k_BT n \frac{1 - \frac{\eta}2}{(1-\eta)^3}
\end{align}
Using the contact-value theorem, we can thus find the contact density
and the well-known correlation function evaluated at contact.
\begin{align}
  n_\textit{contact} &= n \frac{1 - \frac{\eta}2}{(1-\eta)^3} \\
  g_{HS}(\sigma) &= \frac{1 - \frac{\eta}2}{(1-\eta)^3}
\end{align}
Thus we can readily derive the contact density for the homogeneous
hard-sphere fluid.  Extending this to the inhomogeneous fluid will
require that we use density-functional theory.

\section{Fundamental-Measure Theory}

We use the White Bear version of the Fundamental-Measure Theory~(FMT)
functional published in reference~\cite{roth2002whitebear}.  The FMT
functional describes the excess free energy of a hard-sphere fluid.
This particular FMT reduces to the Carnahan-Starling equation of state
for homogeneous systems.
\begin{equation}
A_\textit{HS}[n] = k_B T \int \left(\Phi_1(\rr) + \Phi_2(\rr) + \Phi_3(\rr)\right) d\rr \; ,
\end{equation}
with integrands
\begin{align}
\Phi_1 &= -n_0 \ln\left( 1 - n_3\right)\\
\Phi_2 &= \frac{n_1 n_2 - \mathbf{n}_{V1} \cdot\mathbf{n}_{V2}}{1-n_3} \\
\Phi_3 &= (n_2^3 - 3 n_2 \mathbf{n}_{V2} \cdot \mathbf{n}_{V2}) \frac{
  n_3 + (1-n_3)^2 \ln(1-n_3)
}{
  36\pi n_3^2\left( 1 - n_3 \right)^2
} ,
\end{align}
using the weighted densities
\begin{align}
  n_3(\rr) &= \int n(\rr') \Theta(\left|\rr - \rr'\right| - R) d\rr' \\
  n_2(\rr) &= \int n(\rr') \delta(\left|\rr - \rr'\right| - R) d\rr'
\end{align}
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{n}_{V2} &= \mathbf{\nabla} n_3 , \quad
  \mathbf{n}_{V1} = \frac{\mathbf{n}_{V2}}{4\pi R} \\
  n_1 &= \frac{n_2}{4\pi R} , \quad
  n_0 = \frac{n_2}{4\pi R^2}
\end{align}

\section{Asymmetrically averaged correlation function}\label{sec:g-A}

When we consider an inhomogeneous system, we may prefer to ask for
\emph{which} sphere we are interested in computing the contact
density.  One way to answer this is to specify a sphere at a fixed
position $\mathbf{r}$.  By making the hard-sphere radius dependent on
position, we can compute the pressure on the hard spheres located at
$\mathbf{r}$.
\begin{align}
  p_{HS}(\mathbf{r}) &= \frac{1}{n(\rr) 4\pi \sigma^2} \frac{\delta
    A_{HS}}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} \label{eq:p_{HS}^A}\\
  \ncontact(\rr) &= \frac{1}{n(\rr) k_BT 4\pi \sigma^2} \frac{\delta
    A_{HS}}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} \\
  g_\sigma^A(\rr) &= \frac{\ncontact(\rr)}{n_A(\rr)} \\
  g_\sigma^A(\rr) &= \frac{1}{n(\rr) n_A(\rr)}\frac{1}{ k_BT 4\pi \sigma^2} \frac{\delta
    A_{HS}}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} \label{eq:g-A-exact}
\end{align}
Equation~\ref{eq:g-A-exact} is an exact expression for $g_\sigma^A$
given the exact functional $A_{HS}$.  In practice, we use the
approximate White Bear functional, and find an approximate expression
for $g_\sigma^A$, which is given in Appendix~\ref{appendix:g-A}.  This
expression will involve more convolutions than are present in the free
energy itself, making this formulation relatively expensive.

  \end{widetext}

\section{Gross's asymmetrically averaged correlation functional}\label{sec:gross}
We compare with the averaged correlation function of
Gross\cite{gross2009density}, which is of the asymmetrical variety
($g_\sigma^A$), where the correlation function is averaged at location
of one of the spheres in concact.
\begin{align}
  g_\sigma^\text{Gross,A} &= \frac{1 - \frac12 n_{3'}}{\left(1 -
    n_{3'}\right)^3} \\
  n_{3'}(\rr) &= \int n(\rr')\Theta(|\rr-\rr'| - 2R) d\rr'
\end{align}
where $n_{3'}$ is an averaged
filling fraction defined in a manner analogous to the $n_3$ of FMT,
but with the hard-sphere radius replaced by the hard-sphere diameter,
so the integrals range over spheres that are twice as large.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{figs/n0}
\caption{Set of hard spheres that included in $n_0(\mathbf{r})$, which
  consist of those which just touch the point $\mathbf{r}$.}
\label{fig:n0}
\end{figure}

\section{Symmetrically averaged correlation function}\label{sec:g-S}

An alternate definition of the averaged correlation function for an
inhomogeneous system would be the correlation function averaged for
spheres \emph{touching at a given point}.  This would be a symmetric
measure, since both spheres involved are treated in the same way.  In
fact, the density of such spheres is just the density $n_0(\rr)$ from
FMT.  See Figure~\ref{fig:n0} for an illustration $n_0$.  Since $n_0$
is the fundamental measure of sphere surface contact, it makes sense
to define a corresponding correlation function $g_\sigma^S$.  This is
\emph{almost} what is done by Yu and  Wu

\fixme{Analogous to the assymetric case is the symmetric, for which 
we are no longer able to simply pick a hypothetical sphere centered 
at position $r$ and expand its radius.  Instead we must formulate a way 
to expand the radii of spheres that just touch a specific point of 
contact and only expand them at that point of contact, in a symmetric 
fashion.  Therefore, when we compute the neccasary derivitives wih 
respect to $R$', we expand a multitude of spheres, all of them positioned 
around and just touching the point $\mathbf{r}$.  When their radii 
expand, each does not expand outward in all directions as in the 
case of A, rather they each expand outward at only the point $\mathbf{r}$.  One can imagine a shell that touches $\mathbf{r}$ that has an infinitesimal bit of shell area protruding outward at $\mathbf{r}$ while the rest of its shell remains 
at radius $R$.  When we expand each sphere that touches $\mathbf{r}$ 
in this peculiar fashion, we have in the end the same amount of shell 
area protruding outward as we would if we had simply expanded one 
sphere in fashion of case A.  Also the protrusions, once added up 
for all spheres sourrounding $\mathbf{r}$, will yield a symmetry 
in their direction of protrusion.  Each protruding sphere bit will 
expand outward from its center and all directions will be covered uniformly.
See Figure \ref{fig:contact}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{figs/contact}
\caption{Set of hard spheres that included in $n_0(\mathbf{r})$, which
  consist of those which just touch the point $\mathbf{r}$.}
\label{fig:contact}
\end{figure}

These qualitative concepts lead us to derivations for the $\frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})}$ term in our derivation of the pressure, eq \ref{eq:p_{HS}}.  The rest of the derivation results when we recognize that instead of dividing the pressure by $n(\mathbf{r})$ and $n_A(\mathbf{r})$ as in the assymmetric case, we will instead divide by $n_0(\mathbf{r})^2$ since we have symmetry around the point $\mathbf{r}$.  This will yield our symmetric correlation, $g_\sigma^S$:

\begin{align}
  p_{HS}(\mathbf{r}) &= \frac{1}{n_0(\rr) 4\pi \sigma^2} \frac{\delta
    A_{HS}}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} \label{eq:p_{HS}^S}\\
  \ncontact(\rr) &= \frac{1}{n_0(\rr) k_BT 4\pi \sigma^2} \frac{\delta
    A_{HS}}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} \\
  g_\sigma^A(\rr) &= \frac{\ncontact(\rr)}{n_0(\rr)} \\
  g_\sigma^A(\rr) &= \frac{1}{n_0(\rr) n_0(\rr)}\frac{1}{ k_BT 4\pi \sigma^2} \frac{\delta
    A_{HS}}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} \label{eq:g-A-exact}
\end{align}}Complete expressions for $g_\sigma^S$ are included in
Appendix~\ref{appendix:g-S}.\\

\section{Yu and Wu's functional}\label{sec:yuwu}

Yu and Wu developed a functional that should correspond to the contact
density at a given contact
position~$g^a$~\cite{yu2002fmt-dft-inhomogeneous-associating}.  We
will compare both their functional as well as ours with simulation
data.  Yu and Wu use a symmetric formulation for $g_\sigma$, but
instead of using $n_0$ as the associated density, it uses a density
given by
\begin{align}
  n_\text{Yu}(\rr) &= n_0(\rr) \zeta(\rr) \\
  \zeta &= 1 - \frac{\mathbf{n_2}\cdot\mathbf{n_2}}{n_2^2}
\end{align}
where the function $\zeta$ is a measure of local inhomogeneity at the
point of contact.  Given this definition of density, their $g_\sigma$ is
given by:
\begin{align}
  g_\sigma^\text{Yu} &= \frac{1}{1-n_3}
    + \frac32 \frac{R n_2}{3}\frac{\zeta}{(1-n_3)^2}
    + \frac12 \frac{\left(\frac{R n_2}{3}\right)^2 \zeta}{(1-n_3)^3}
    \\
  g_\sigma^\text{Yu} &= \frac{1}{1-n_3}
    + \frac12 \frac{R n_2\zeta}{(1-n_3)^2}
    + \frac1{18} \frac{R^2 n_2^2 \zeta}{(1-n_3)^3}
    \\
  g_\sigma^\text{Yu,S} &= \zeta^2\left(\frac{1}{1-n_3}
    + \frac12 \frac{R n_2\zeta}{(1-n_3)^2}
    + \frac1{18} \frac{R^2 n_2^2 \zeta}{(1-n_3)^3}\right)
\end{align}
I think the adjusted functional $g_\sigma^{\text{Yu,}S}$ can be directly
compared with our $g_\sigma^S$.  It is implemented in our code.

\section{Comparison with simulation}

We performed a Monte-Carlo simulation of the hard sphere fluid to
measure the contact density as a function of position for a few simple
geometries.  For each scenario, we compute and compare several
quantities.  We compare the Monte Carlo density with the DFT
prediction.  We also plot Monte Carlo results for the two contact
densities: the contact density evaluated at contact, and the contact
density evaluated at the sphere location.  Alongside these, we plot
the contact density of Yu and
Wu~\cite{yu2002fmt-dft-inhomogeneous-associating}, the contact density
of Gross~\cite{gross2009density}, and the ``contact density at
sphere'' from Section~\ref{sec:g-A}.  In principle, the
functional of Yu (FIXME) should match the CenConDensity, while the DFT
at sphere should match the ConDensity...

density:  the case of hard spheres near a single hard wall.  This is
shown in Figures~\ref{fig:walls-10}-\ref{fig:walls-40}.

\subsection{Hard spheres confined in a spherical cavity}

The first geometry we consider is a number of hard spheres confined
within a spherical cavity.  In
Figures~\ref{fig:sphere-8}-\ref{fig:sphere-16}, we show
the densities and contact densities for several cavity sizes.  In each
case, the number of hard spheres was chosen to set the mean filling
fraction to around 0.3?.  This value was chosen because it roughly
corresponds to the filling fraction of water at standard atmospheric
temperature and pressure in the optimal SAFT model developed by Clark
\emph{et al}\cite{clark2006developing}.

\subsection{Hard spheres around a hard sphere}

It is also interesting to study a system with opposite curvature.  Put
a (larger) hard sphere in the hard-sphere fluid, and see what the
contact density is around that hard sphere.  This is particularly
relevant when we consider using classical density-functional theory to
model solvation.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusion}
We (will) have compared several functionals for the contact density of
a hard-sphere fluid with simulations.  This quantity is of particular
interest, as it plays a critical role in Statistical Associating Fluid
Theory (SAFT), which is the basis of a number of recent classical
density functionals.  We compute the contact density directly from the
White Bear version of the FMT hard-sphere functional, and find
reasonable agreement?

\section*{Introduction to Appendices}

In our expressions for pressure (eq \ref{eq:p_{HS}^A} and eq \ref{eq:p_{HS}^S}) we have $\frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})}$ terms that must be derived for both the S and A cases.  We break these terms up as follows:   

  \begin{align}
    \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} &=
    \int \left(
    \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_3(\mathbf{r}')}
    \frac{\delta n_3(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})}
    +
    \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_2(\mathbf{r}')}
    \frac{\delta n_2(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})}
    + \cdots
    \right) d\mathbf{r}'
  \end{align}
 

We must therefore compute both the $\frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n(\mathbf{r}')}$, etc., terms and the $\frac{\delta n(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})}$, etc., terms.  We will compute the $\frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n(\mathbf{r}')}$, etc., terms for both the functional derived in the White Bear I formulation and for that in the White Bear II formulation.  Following this we will compute the $\frac{\delta n(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})}$, etc., terms for both the A and S cases.  These latter derivitives will differ for the A and S cases according to the qualitive concepts described above. 

\subsection{Expressions for $\beta\frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_3(\mathbf{r}')}$, etc. for the White Bear Mark I free energy $A_{HS}$}

  First, let's rewrite the free energy in terms of a smaller set of weighted densities
  
  \begin{align}
    A_{HS} &= \int \left\{
    -n_0 \ln\left( 1 - n_3\right)
    + \frac{n_1 n_2 - \mathbf{n}_{V1} \cdot\mathbf{n}_{V2}}{1-n_3}
    + (n_2^3 - 3 n_2 \mathbf{n}_{V2} \cdot \mathbf{n}_{V2}) \frac{
      n_3 + (1-n_3)^2 \ln(1-n_3)
    }{
      36\pi n_3^2(1-n_3)^2
    }
    \right\}
  \end{align}
  
Taking derivatives we have

  \begin{align}
    \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_3(\mathbf{r}')} &=
    \frac{n_0(\mathbf{r}')}{1 - n_3(\mathbf{r}')}
    + \frac{n_1n_2 - \mathbf{n}_{V1}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{V2}}{(1 -
      n_3(\mathbf{r}'))^2}
    - \frac{n_2^3 -
      3n_2\mathbf{n}_{V2}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{V2}}{36\pi}\left(
    \frac{n_3^2-5n_3+2}{n_3^3(1-n_3)^3} + 2\frac{\ln(1-n_3)}{n_3^3}
    \right)
    \\
    \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_2(\mathbf{r}')} &=
    \frac{n_1}{1-n_3}
    + 3(n_2^2 - \mathbf{n}_{V2}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{V2})\frac{n_3 +
      (1-n_3)^2\ln(1-n_3)}{
      36\pi n_3^2(1-n_3)^2
    }
    \\
    \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_1(\mathbf{r}')} &= \frac{n_2}{1-n_3}
    \\
    \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_0(\mathbf{r}')} &=
    -\ln\left( 1 - n_3\right) \\
    \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta \mathbf{n}_{V2}(\mathbf{r}')} &=
    \frac{\mathbf{n}_{V1}}{1-n_3}
    - 6 n_2 \mathbf{n}_{V2} \frac{n_3 +
      (1-n_3)^2\ln(1-n_3)}{
      36\pi n_3^2(1-n_3)^2
    }    \\
    \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta \mathbf{n}_{V1}(\mathbf{r}')} &=
    \frac{\mathbf{n}_{V2}}{1-n_3} \\
  \end{align}


\subsection{Expressions for $\beta\frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_3(\mathbf{r}')}$, etc. for the White Brear Mark II free energy $A_{HS}$}

Similarly to the White Bear I case we first write

\begin{align} 
A_{HS} &= \int \left\{
    -n_0 \ln\left(1 - n_3\right)
    + \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}n_3^2 \phi_2(n_3)\right)   \frac{n_1 n_2 - \mathbf{n}_{V1} \cdot\mathbf{n}_{V2}}{1-n_3}
    + \left(1 - \frac{4}{9}n_3\phi_3(n_3)\right)\frac{n_2^3 - 3 n_2 \mathbf{n}_{V2} \cdot \mathbf{n}_{V2}}{24\pi (1-n_3)^2}
    \right\}
\end{align}
 where
 \begin{align}
   \phi_2 &= \left(6n_3 - 3n_3^2 + 6(1-n_3)\ln(1-n_3)\right)\frac{1}{n_3^3}\\
   \phi_3 &= \left(6n_3 - 9n_3^2 + 6n_3^3 + 6(1-n_3)^2 \ln(1-n_3)\right)\frac{1}{4n_3^3}
 \end{align}
For the following derivitives we have
\begin{align}
   \frac{\delta \phi_2}{\delta n_3} &= \left((-6+4n_3)\ln(1-n_3) - 6n_3 + n_3^2\right)\frac{3}{n_3^4}\\
   \frac{\delta \phi_3}{\delta n_3} &= \left(-6n_3 + 5n_3^2 + (-2n_3^2 + 8n_3 -6)\ln(1-n_3)\right)\frac{3}{4n_3^4}
 \end{align}
And using these
\begin{align}
  \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_3} &= \psi _1 + \psi _2 + \psi _3
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \psi_1 &= \frac{n_0}{1-n_3}\\
  \psi_2 &= \frac{n_1n_2 - \mathbf{n}_1\cdot \mathbf{n}_2}{1-n_3}\left(\frac{2}{9}n_3\phi_2 + \frac{1}{9}n_3^2\frac{\delta \phi_2}{\delta n_3}\right) + \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}n_3^2\phi_2\right)\frac{n_1n_2 - \mathbf{n}_1\cdot \mathbf{n}_2}{(1-n_3)^2}\\
  \psi_3 &= \frac{n_2^3 - 3n_2\mathbf{n}_2 \cdot \mathbf{n}_2}{24\pi(1-n_3)^2}\left(-\frac{4}{9}\phi_3 - \frac{4}{9}n_3\frac{\delta \phi_3}{\delta n_3}\right) + 2\left(1 - \frac{4}{9}n_3\phi_3\right)\frac{n_2^3 - 3n_2\mathbf{n}_2 \cdot \mathbf{n}_2}{24\pi(1-n_3)^3} 
\end{align}
We also have
\begin{align}
  \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_2} &= (1 + \frac{1}{9}n_3^2\phi_2)\frac{n_1}{1-n_3} + (1 - \frac{4}{9}n_3\phi_3)\frac{3n_2^2 - 3\mathbf{n}_2 \cdot \mathbf{n}_2}{24\pi(1 - n_3)^2}\\
  \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_1} &= (1 + \frac{1}{9}n_3^2\phi_2)\frac{n_2}{1 - n_3}\\
  \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_0} &= -\ln(1 - n_3)\\
  \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta \mathbf{n}_1} &= -(1 + \frac{1}{9}n_3^2 \phi_2)\frac{\mathbf{n}_2}{1 - n_3}\\
  \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta \mathbf{n}_2} &= -(1 + \frac{1}{9}n_3^2\phi_2)\frac{\mathbf{n}_1}{1 - n_3} 
  - (1 - \frac{4}{9}n_3\phi_3)\frac{6n_2\mathbf{n}_2}{24\pi(1 - n_3)^2}
\end{align}


\subsection{Expressions for $\beta\frac{\delta n_3^{A}(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})}$, etc. for the assymetric case}\label{appendix:g-A}

In the case of A, the changing radius we refer to is the radius of a sphere that is centered at $\mathbf{r}$.  The $n_3$ values that will be affected are those which are a distance $R$ from $\mathbf{r}$.

\begin{align}
  n_3^{A}(\mathbf{r}') &= \int n(\mathbf{r}'') \Theta(\left|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''\right| -R(\mathbf{r}'')) d\mathbf{r}''\\ 
  \frac{\delta n_3^{A} (\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} &=
  \int n (\mathbf{r}'') \delta(|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''| - R(\mathbf{r}'')) \delta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'') d\mathbf{r}'' \\
   &= n (\mathbf{r}) \delta(|\mathbf{r'} - \mathbf{r}| - R(\mathbf{r}))
\end{align}
 
And likewise:
\begin{align}
  n_2^{A}(\mathbf{r}') &= \int n(\mathbf{r}'') \delta(|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''| - R(\mathbf{r}'')) d \mathbf{r}''\\
  \frac{\delta n_2^{A}(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} &= -n(\mathbf{r}) \delta'(|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}| - R(\mathbf{r}))\\
 \end{align}

where the trouble here is that the derivative of the delta function,
$\delta'$, isn't something we really like to deal with.  Particularly
as we're looking  at a 3D integral involving a 1D delta function,
which means there are Jacobian factors to be considered.  On the other
hand, there's no reason why we couldn't convolve with this kernel as
efficiently as we do with any other kernel.
\\
\\
The derivatives of the remaining scalar densities can be reduced to
sums of the terms above:
\begin{align}
  n_1(\mathbf{r}') &= \int \mathbf{dr''} \frac{n(\mathbf{r''})}{4\pi R(\mathbf{r''})}
  \delta(|\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r''}| - R(\mathbf{r''})) \\
  \frac{\delta n_1(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})}
  &= -\frac{n(\mathbf{r})}{4\pi
    R(\mathbf{r})}\delta'(|\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r}| - R(\mathbf{r}))
  -
  \frac{n(\mathbf{r})}{4\pi
    R(\mathbf{r})^2}\delta(|\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r}| - R(\mathbf{r}))
\end{align}
\begin{align}
  n_0(\mathbf{r}') &= \int \mathbf{dr''} \frac{n(\mathbf{r''})}{4\pi R(\mathbf{r''})^2}
  \delta(|\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r''}| - R(\mathbf{r''})) \\
  \frac{\delta n_1(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})^2}
  &= -\frac{n(\mathbf{r})}{4\pi
    R(\mathbf{r})^2}\delta'(|\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r}| - R(\mathbf{r}))
  -
  2\frac{n(\mathbf{r})}{4\pi
    R(\mathbf{r})^3}\delta(|\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r}| - R(\mathbf{r}))
\end{align}

Since the vector-weighted densities have no additional occurrences of
$R$, their derivatives come out similarly.
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{n}_{V2}^{A}(\mathbf{r}') &= \int n(\mathbf{r}'') \delta(|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''| - R(\mathbf{r}'')) 
    \frac{\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r''}}{|\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r''}|} d \mathbf{r}''\\
  \frac{\delta \mathbf{n}_{V2}^{A}(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} &= - n(\mathbf{r}) \delta'(|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}| - R(\mathbf{r}))
    \frac{\mathbf{r}'-\mathbf{r}}{|\mathbf{r}'-\mathbf{r}|}\\
\end{align}

and analogously for $\mathbf{n}_{V1}$:

\begin{align}
  \mathbf{n}_{V1}(\mathbf{r}') &= \int \mathbf{dr''} \frac{n(\mathbf{r''})}{4\pi R(\mathbf{r''})}
  \delta(|\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r''}| - R(\mathbf{r''})) \frac{\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r}}{|\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r}|}\\
  \frac{\delta \mathbf{n}_{V1}(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})}
  &= -\frac{n(\mathbf{r})}{4\pi
    R(\mathbf{r})}\delta'(|\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r}| - R(\mathbf{r})) \frac{\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r}}{|\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r}|}
  -
  \frac{n(\mathbf{r})}{4\pi
    R(\mathbf{r})^2}\delta(|\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r}| - R(\mathbf{r})) \frac{\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r}}{|\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r}|}  
\end{align}

So, what is this convolution with a $\delta'$? Let's look at the
scalar version:
\fixme{With following the primes are certainly not in the right places}
\begin{align}
  \bar{f}(\mathbf{r})
  &= \int f(\mathbf{r'}) \delta'(|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}| - R)
  \\
  &= \int
        f(\mathbf{r'})
        \lim_{\Delta R \rightarrow 0}
          \frac{\delta(|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}| - R - \Delta R)
            -
            \delta(|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}| - R)
      }{\Delta R}
  \\
  &= \lim_{\Delta R \rightarrow 0}
          \frac{\int
            f(\mathbf{r'})
            \delta(|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}| - R - \Delta R)
            -
            \int
            f(\mathbf{r'})
            \delta(|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}| - R)
      }{\Delta R}
  \\
  &\approx\lim_{\Delta R \rightarrow 0}
          \frac{\int
            \frac{(R+\Delta R)^2}{R^2}f(\mathbf{r'})
            \delta(|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}| - R)
            -
            \int
            f(\mathbf{r'})
            \delta(|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}| - R)
      }{\Delta R}
  \\
  &\approx\lim_{\Delta R \rightarrow 0}
          \frac{2\frac{\Delta R}{R} \int
            f(\mathbf{r'})
            \delta(|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}| - R)
      }{\Delta R}
  \\
  &= \frac{2}{R} \int
            f(\mathbf{r'})
            \delta(|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}| - R)
\end{align}
There is a sign ambiguity here with regard to whether we are asking
about the derivative of this delta function with regard to $R$ or
something else.  We just need to get it right.

\subsection{Expressions for $\beta\frac{\delta n_3^{S}(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})}$, etc. for the symetric case}\label{appendix:g-S}


For the derivation of $n_{3}$ in the symmetric case:

\begin{align}  
  n_3^{S}(\mathbf{r}') &= \int n(\mathbf{r}'') \Theta(\left|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''\right| -R(\mathbf{r}')) d\mathbf{r}''\\
  \frac{\delta n_3^{S} (\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} &=
  \int n (\mathbf{r}'') \delta(|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''| - R(\mathbf{r}')) \delta(\mathbf{r}'-\mathbf{r}) d\mathbf{r}''
\end{align}
  
\fixme{Not sure if we need any more explanation here (probably want better than this) -  $\delta R(\mathbf{r})$ in this equation refers to an expansion, in the fashion described above, of all the spheres that just touch $\mathbf{r}$.  We can see that if the radii change in this fashion, the only point at which $n_3(\mathbf{r}')$ will be affected is at $\mathbf{r}' = \mathbf{r}$, so that $\delta n_3(\mathbf{r}')$ is zero everywhere except where $\mathbf{r}' = \mathbf{r}$.  Thus we have the 2nd $\delta$ function in the lower integral.}
\\
\\
This term in the free energy functional, once integrated, takes an interesting form:  

\begin{align}
  \int \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_3^{S}(\mathbf{r}')} 
  \frac{\delta n_3^{S}(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} d\mathbf{r}' 
  &= \int \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_3^{S}(\mathbf{r}')} \int n (\mathbf{r}'') \delta(|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''| - R(\mathbf{r}')) \delta(\mathbf{r}'-\mathbf{r}) d\mathbf{r}'' d\mathbf{r}' \\
  &= \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_3^{S}(\mathbf{r}')} \int n (\mathbf{r}'') \delta(|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}''| - R(\mathbf{r})) d\mathbf{r}''\\
  &= \frac{\delta A_{HS}}{\delta n_3^{S}(\mathbf{r}'')} n_2(\mathbf{r})\\
\end{align}
  
 $n_2(\mathbf{r}')$ in the case of S in calculated similarly
\begin{align}
  n_2^{S}(\mathbf{r}') &= \int n(\mathbf{r}'') \delta(|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''| + R(\mathbf{r}'))d\mathbf r''\\
    \frac{\delta n_2^{S}(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} &= -\int n(\mathbf{r}'') 
  \delta'(|\mathbf{r}'-\mathbf{r}''| - R(\mathbf{r}')) \delta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}') d\mathbf{r}''
\end{align}

And similarly to the A case we compute
\begin{align}
  n_1^{S}(\mathbf{r}') &= \int \frac{n(\mathbf{r}'')}{4\pi R(\mathbf{r})} \delta(|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''| + R(\mathbf{r}'))d\mathbf r''\\
    \frac{\delta n_1^{S}(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} &= -\int \frac{n(\mathbf{r}'')}{4\pi R(\mathbf{r})} 
  \delta'(|\mathbf{r}'-\mathbf{r}''| - R(\mathbf{r}')) \delta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}') d\mathbf{r}'' 
  -
  \int \frac{n(\mathbf{r}'')}{4\pi R(\mathbf{r})^2} \delta(|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''| + R(\mathbf{r}'))d\mathbf r''
\end{align}

and 
\begin{align}
  n_0^{S}(\mathbf{r}') &= \int \frac{n(\mathbf{r}'')}{4\pi R(\mathbf{r})^2} \delta(|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''| + R(\mathbf{r}'))d\mathbf r''\\
    \frac{\delta n_0^{S}(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} &= -\int \frac{n(\mathbf{r}'')}{4\pi R(\mathbf{r})^2} 
  \delta'(|\mathbf{r}'-\mathbf{r}''| - R(\mathbf{r}')) \delta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}') d\mathbf{r}'' 
  -
  2\int \frac{n(\mathbf{r}'')}{4\pi R(\mathbf{r})^3} \delta(|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''| + R(\mathbf{r}'))d\mathbf r''
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  \mathbf{n}_{V2}^{S}(\mathbf{r}') &= \int n(\mathbf{r}'') \delta(|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''| - R(\mathbf{r}'))
  \frac{(\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}'')}{|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''|} d \mathbf{r}''\\
  \frac{\delta \mathbf{n}_{V2}^{S}(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} &= \delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}')
  \int n(\mathbf{r}'') \delta'(|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''| - R(\mathbf{r}')) 
  \frac{(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'')}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}''|} d\mathbf{r}''
\end{align}

\begin{align}
 \mathbf{n}_{V1}^{S}(\mathbf{r}') &= \int \frac{n(\mathbf{r}'')}{4\pi R(\mathbf{r})} \delta(|\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}''| + R(\mathbf{r}'))d\mathbf r''
   \frac{(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'')}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}''|}\\
 \frac{\delta \mathbf{n}_{V1}^{S}(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} &= -\int \frac{n(\mathbf{r}'')}{4\pi R(\mathbf{r})} 
   \delta'(|\mathbf{r}'-\mathbf{r}''| - R(\mathbf{r}')) \delta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}') d\mathbf{r}'' \frac{(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'')}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}''|} 
   -

  p(\mathbf{r}) &= \frac{\delta A}{\delta n_2(\mathbf{r}')} \frac{\delta n_2(\mathbf{r}')}{\delta R(\mathbf{r})} d\mathbf{r}'\\
  &= \frac{\delta A}{\delta n_2(\mathbf{r})} - \int n(\mathbf{r}'') \delta' (|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}''| - R) d\mathbf{r}''
  \int n (\mathbf{r} +\mathbf{r}'') \delta'(|\mathbf{r}'''| - R) d \mathbf{r}'''\\
  &= \int n(\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{r}''') \delta'(|\mathbf{r}'''| - R) r'''^2 cos\theta d \theta''' dr'''\\
  du = \delta'(\mathbf{r}''' - R) d \mathbf{r}'''     v = n(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'')r'''\\
   u = \delta(\mathbf{r}''' - R)                       
   dv = \mathbf{\nabla} n(\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{r}'') \cdot \frac{\mathbf{r}'''}{r'''} + 2n(\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}'')r'''\\
  &= -\int(\mathbf{\nabla}n(\mathbf{r}' + \mathbf{r}'') \cdot \mathbf r'''(hat)r'''^2 dr''' 
  + 2n(\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{r}''')r''') dr''' \delta(\mathbf{r} - R) dcos\theta''' d\theta''\\
  &= - \int \delta(\mathbf{r}''' - R) d\mathbf{r}''' 
  (\mathbf{\nabla}n(\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{r}''') \cdot \mathbf{r}''' (hat) + \frac{2n(\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{r}'')}{\mathbf{r}'''})\\
  &= \frac{2n_2(\mathbf{r})}{R} + 
  \int \delta(|\mathbf{r}'''| - R) \mathbf{\nabla}n(\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{r}''') \cdot \mathbf{r}''' (hat) d \mathbf{r}'''\\
\end{align}
