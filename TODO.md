- Implement huge repulsive external potential, to make sure we can
  look at a hard-surface cavity.

- Write a program to do surface-tension calculations by putting an
  infinite barrier at one spot, and adjusting the chemical potential
  until we have a liquid-vapor interface and then setting the chemical
  potential back to its desired value and re-relaxing.  Or perhaps
  fixing the density at vapor and liquid densities at two planes in
  space?

- Implement conjugate gradients minimization.

- Implement smart stop condition for minimization as I did in DFT++.

- Implement White Bear hard-sphere functional.

- Look up Fu in paper to find what
