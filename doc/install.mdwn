Building deft
=============

To build, just run:

    sh autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

Building on Ubuntu Precise Pangolin
===================================

You need ...

    haskell-mode # optional, but handy
    fftw3-dev
    g++
    gfortran
    ghc
    libghc-hunit-dev
    texlive-full
    gnuplot
    python-matplotlib
    python-scipy

Running the test suite
======================

You can run the tests with

    make check

If a test fails, and you want to just rerun it to see if you fixed it,
you can rerun only those tests that failed with

    make recheck

To write a new test
-------------------

Create a new file such as

    tests/my-new-feature.cpp

Then add that test to `Makefile.am`

    check_PROGRAMS = \
        tests/my-new-feature.test \
    ...
    tests_my_new_feature_test_SOURCES = tests/my-new-feature.cpp $(GENERIC_CODE)
    
At this point, `make check` should do what you want.
