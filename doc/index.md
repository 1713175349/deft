# Deft home page

[TOC]

Deft is a classical density-functional theory code developed by the
[Roundy research group](http://physics.oregonstate.edu/~roundyd).

* First, you'll want to [install](install.html) it.
* There's also a [FAQ](faq.html).
* Read about how to configure your [editors](editors.html) properly.
* Read about how the code is [organized](code-organization.html).
* Jeff is trying to create a [General cheat sheet](general-cheat-sheet.html)
* We can use [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to build deft
  within a virtual machine.  This may be a painless way to build deft
  on a machine that is not running linux, but is not yet very
  thoroughly tested.  [Read about using vagrant with deft!](vagrant.html)
