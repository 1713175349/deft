# Vagrant

You can develop deft in a vagrant virtual machine.  To do this, you
will want to use the following commands (after installing vagrant)
within the deft repository.

    $ vagrant up jessie
    $ vagrant ssh jessie
    $ cd /vagrant
    $ fac

At this point you will have built deft within the vagrant virtual
machine.
