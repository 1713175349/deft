# The `src/` directory

This is where most of our core code is located.

1. `src/haskell/` The haskell code is located here. This code is used
   to generate some of our C++ source code.

2. `src/new/` This is where the "new" codebase is located.  This is
   the recommended version of the DFT code.

3. `src/MonteCarlo` is where we keep our Monte Carlo codes.
