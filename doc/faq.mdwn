Deft frequently asked questions.

## How do I add a new C++ file to the deft core?

First create a new file in the `src/` directory.  Then
you edit the `Makefile.am` file, and search for a similar
file and make similar additions everywhere it shows up.


## How do I create a new C++ program to generate data?

We keep programs that generate data in `papers/PAPERNAME/figs/`,
so you'll want to create a `.cpp` file in that directory.  Then,
as in the case of a deft core file above, you edit `Makefile.am`,
and copy a similar file, making similar additions where ever it
shows up.  If you want your program to be automatically run when
building papers (which you should, if it runs quickly), then you
need to be sure to add a `.dat` dependency, which will tell make
to run your program.  Programs that generate data are built with
a `.mkdat` extension, which when run should generate a file with
a `.dat` extension, and the same base name.

## How do I speed up the make on srun?

You can run with multiple cores, designated by -j4

    srun -p debian -c4 make papers -j4

The `-c4` tells srun that make will use 4 cores.  The `-j4` tells make to use 4 cores.
If the srun job does not start immediately you will want to reduce the number of cores used.
The idea being that all the processes will run on a single node.
