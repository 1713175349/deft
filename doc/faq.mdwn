Deft frequently asked questions.

[[!toc ]]

## Has anyone ever asked a question about Deft?

No.


## How do I add a new C++ file to the deft core?

You edit the Makefile.am file, and search for a similar
file and make similar additions everywhere it shows up.

## How do I speed up the make on srun?

You can run with multiple cores, designated by -j4

    srun -p debian -c4 make papers -j4

The `-c4` tells srun that make will use 4 cores.  The `-j4` tells make to use 4 cores.
If the srun job does not start immediately you will want to reduce the number of cores used.
The idea being that all the processes will run on a single node.
