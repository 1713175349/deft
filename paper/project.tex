\section{Theory and Methods}

We introduce a new classical density functional for water that
\needsworklater{predicts the vapor density, liquid density, bulk
  modulus, and bulk surface tension, as well as allows for
  liquid-vapor coexistence}.  The Helmholtz free energy functional is
based on SAFT, and is composed of the usual terms:
\begin{equation}
  F[n] = F_\textit{id}[n] + F_\textit{hs}[n] + F_\textit{assoc}[n] + F_\textit{disp},
\end{equation}
where $F_\textit{id}$ is the ideal gas free energy, $F_\textit{hs}$ is
a hard-sphere free energy, $F_\textit{assoc}$ is the free energy of
association, and $F_\textit{disp}$ is the dispersion energy.  In
addition, a chemical potential term is used, so we actually work in
the grand canonical ensemble.  In the following sections, we will
introduce the terms of this functional.

\subsection{Ideal gas functional}
The first term is the ideal gas free energy functional,
which incorporates effects of kinetic energy.  The ideal gas
functional is given by
\begin{equation}\label{idealgas}
  F_{id}[n] = k_B T \int n(\xx)\left( \ln{n(\xx)} - 1\right) d\xx
\end{equation}
where n(\xx) is the density of water molecules.  The ideal gas free
energy functional has the property that the contact density at a hard
surface $n_c$ is proportional to the pressure on that surface,
according to the equation
\begin{equation}
  p = n_c k_BT \:,
\end{equation}
which also leads to the property that the free energy of solvation of
a hard solute is proportional to its volume in the limit of small
solutes.  These properties are retained by the total functional,
provided the remaining terms are \emph{purely
  nonlocal}~\cite{ashcroft?}.

\subsection{Hard-sphere repulsion}
The repulsive intermolecular interactions are modeled using a
Fundamental\nobreakdash-Measure Theory~\cite{rosenfeld1997}(FMT) functional,
which combines scaled-particle theory and the Percus-Yevick theory,
and an attractive interaction.  The FMT functional treats
each water molecule as a hard sphere with a radius approximately that of
a water molecule $(R~=~2.3~bohr)$.\\


We model the repulsive interactions using the White Bear version of
the Fundamental-Measure Theory~(FMT) functional published in
reference~\cite{roth2002whitebear}.  \needsworklater{The FMT
  functional describes the excess free energy of a hard-sphere
  fluid. Fundamental-Measure Theory has several advantages over other
  approaches, one of the most important being the simplicity of
  calculations.  This particular FMT also reliably predicts bulk
  properties of fluids in one, two and three dimensions, as well as
  exactly determines the excess free energy in the zero dimensional
  limit.}

The hard sphere functional is adapted from that of
Rosenfeld~\cite{rosenfeld1997},
and is given by
\begin{equation}
F_{hs}[n] = k_B T \int (\Phi_1 + \Phi_2 + \Phi_3) d\xx \; ,
\end{equation}
with integrands
\begin{align}
\Phi_1 &= -n\circ w_2 \ln\left( 1-\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 n\circ w_1\right)\\
\Phi_2 &= \frac{4\pi R^3 \lbrack (n\circ w_2)^2 - (n\circ \mathbf{w}_3)^2\rbrack}
          {\left( 1-\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 n\circ w_1\right)}\\
\Phi_3 &= \frac{8\pi^2 R^6\lbrack \frac{1}{3}(n\circ w_2)^3 - (n\circ
          w_2)(n\circ \mathbf{w}_3)^2\rbrack}
          {\left( 1-\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 n\circ w_1\right)} \; ,
\end{align}
using the normalized weighting functions 
\begin{align}
w_1(\xx) &= \frac{3}{4\pi R^3}\Theta(R-|\xx|)\\
w_2(\xx) &= \frac{1}{4\pi R^2}\delta(R-|\xx|)\\
\mathbf{w}_3(\xx) &= \frac{-1}{4\pi R^2}\vec{\nabla}\Theta(R-|\xx|) \; .
\end{align}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Association free energy}
To the purely repulsive hard-sphere free energy, we add two attractive
energy terms.  The first is the free energy of \emph{association},
which describes the effects of hydrogen bonds.  These are modeled as
four attractive patches (``association sites'') on the surface of the
hard sphere.  These four sites represent the two hydrogens and two
electron lone pairs.  There is an attractive energy
$\epsilon_\textit{assoc}$ when two molecules are arranged such that
the hydrogen of one interacts with the lone pair of the other.  The
volume of this interaction is $\kappa_\textit{assoc}$.  Thus the
association term in the free energy has two free parameters that must
be fit based on experimental data.

The association free energy has the form
\begin{align}
  F_\text{assoc}[n] &= 4 k_BT \int n_0(\xx)
  \left(\ln X(\xx) - \frac{X(\xx)}{2} + \frac12\right) d\xx
\end{align}
where the value of $4$ comes from the four association sites per
molecule, and the functional $X$ is the fraction of association sites
\emph{not} hydrogen-bonded.  The fraction $X$ is determined by the
quadratic equation
\begin{align}
  X(\xx) &= \frac{\sqrt{1 + 8n_0(\xx)\zeta(\xx)\Delta(\xx)} - 1}
  {4 n_0(\xx)\zeta(\xx)\Delta(\xx)}
\end{align}
where $\zeta$ comes from
reference\cite{yu2002fmt-dft-inhomogeneous-associating,
  fu2005vapor-liquid-dft} and describes the inhomogeneity of the fluid
density:
\begin{align}
  \zeta(\xx) &= 1 - \frac{\mathbf{n_{2V}}\cdot\mathbf{n_{2V}}}{n_2^2}
\end{align}
The function $\Delta$ is given... below?

The following contact density for the hard-sphere fluid is in the code
called \texttt{gHS}, and comes
from\cite{yu2002fmt-dft-inhomogeneous-associating,
  fu2005vapor-liquid-dft}, but I don't use it.
\begin{align}
  \Delta &= 4\pi \kappa_\textit{assoc} g^\textit{HS}(\sigma)e^{-\beta
    \epsilon_\textit{assoc}} \\
  g^\textit{HS}(\sigma) &= \frac1{1-n_3}\left(1+\frac14\frac{\zeta n_2}{1-n_3}
  \left(1 + \frac{n_2}{14 (1-n_3)}\right)\right)
\end{align}
\textcolor{red}{Here is paper where I got the association functional:}

Instead, I use
\begin{align}
  \Delta(\xx) &= \kappa_\textit{assoc}
  e^{-\beta\epsilon_\textit{assoc}} g^\textit{SW}_\sigma(\xx) \\
  g^\textit{SW}_\sigma(\xx) &= g^\textit{HS}_\sigma(\xx) +
  \frac{1}{4}\beta\left(\frac{\partial a_1(\xx)}{\partial n_3(\xx)} -
  \frac{lambda}{3 n3(\xx)}\frac{\partial a_1(\xx)}{\partial \lambda}\right)
\end{align}
% This is equation 77 of gil-villegas-1997-SAFT-VR
which I got from reference\cite{gil-villegas-1997-SAFT-VR}.

  versus temperature.  }
\label{fig:saturated-liquid-density}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dispersion free energy}
The final term in the free energy is the dispersion term.  We use a
dispersion term based on the SAFT-VR
approach\cite{gil-villegas-1997-SAFT-VR}, which has two free
parameters, an interaction energy $\epsilon_\textit{disp}$ and a
length scale $\lambda_\textit{disp}$.

The dispersion free energy has the form~\cite{gil-villegas-1997-SAFT-VR}
\begin{align}
  F_\text{disp} &= A_1 + \beta A_2
\end{align}
where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the first two terms in a high-temperature
perturbation expansion.  $A_1$ is the mean-field dispersion
interaction, which for a homogeneous fluid is given by
\begin{align}
  A_1 &= \frac12 n_b \int \varphi(\left|\xx\right|)
  g_{HS}(\left|\xx\right|) d\xx
\end{align}
The second dispersion term in the free energy $A_2$ describes the
effect of fluctuations resulting from the compression of the fluid due
to the dispersion interaction itself, and is commonly approximated
using the local compressibility approximation (LCA).

We use a free square-well function for the dispersion $\varphi$, which
has been demonstrated \textcolor{red}{(CITE)} to give a reasonable fit
to the equation of state.  Thus our model interaction has the form:
\begin{equation}
  \varphi(r) = \Theta(r-2 \lambda_\textit{disp} R)
\end{equation}
where $\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function.

\textcolor{red}{TODO:  Add the actual functions that we use and the
  actual form.  The above is really just an introduction.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Other thermodynamic functions}

From the Helmholtz free energy functional, we may obtain any other
thermodynamic functions we should choose.  The grand free energy
$\Phi$, which we ordinarily use in our computations, is obtained by
simply adding a chemical potential term:
\begin{equation}
  \Phi[n] = F[n] + \mu \int n(\xx) d\xx
\end{equation}

The pressure would naturally be obtained by taking a partial
derivative with respect to volume at fixed temperature.  Since
\emph{volume} isn't a parameter in density-functional theory, we
consider the \emph{free energy per unit volume}.
\begin{align}
  F[n] &= f[n]V \\
  p[n] &= -\left(\frac{\partial F[n]}{\partial V}\right)_{T} \\
  &= -\left(\frac{\partial f[n]V}{\partial V}\right)_{T} \\
  &= -V\left(\frac{\partial f[n]}{\partial V}\right)_{T}
   - f[n]\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial V}\right)_{T} \\
  &= n \left(\frac{\partial f[n]}{\partial n}\right)_{T} - f[n]
\end{align}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/pressure-with-isotherms}
\end{center}
\caption{The pressure versus density for various temperatures, including experimental pressure data from NIST.  }
\label{fig:pressure-with-isotherms}
\end{figure}

The entropy is naturally obtained by taking a partial derivative with
respect to temperature:
\begin{align}
  S[n] &= \left(\frac{\partial F[n]}{\partial T}\right)_{V}
\end{align}
This derivative is trivial for the ideal gas and hard sphere free
energies, which are simply proportional to the temperature.  For the
association and dispersion free energies, it is a little more work,
but still not hard.

Once we have the entropy, finding the internal energy is a simple
matter of subtraction:
\begin{align}
  U[n] &= F[n] + TS[n]
\end{align}
and the enthalpy is not much more work:
\begin{align}
  H[n] &= F[n] + TS[n] - pV
\end{align}

\subsection{Determining the empirical parameters}\label{sec:empirical}

In order to ensure that the empirical parameters are correct, we test
the vapor pressure (see Figure~\ref{fig:equation-of-state}) and
saturated liquid density (see
Figure~\ref{fig:saturated-liquid-density}) against experimental
values.  To find these densities, we use the ``common tangent'' rule,
as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:homogeneous}.

\section{Results and discussion}
\subsection{Liquid-vapor interface}

We compute the density profile and surface tension by relaxing a slab
of water in a periodic unit cell.  This slab has two surfaces, so the
surface tension is just half the free energy of the cell, divided by
its cross-sectional area.  As mentioned in
section~\ref{sec:empirical}, the $b$ parameter is determined by
setting this surface tension to match the experimental value.  The
associated density profile is plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:cartesianDensity}, which displays two peaks in
density.

The fluid density at a liquid-solid interface commonly displays
oscillatory behavior, but the presence of density oscillations at
liquid-vapor interfaces is more debated\cite{penfold2001structure}.
In fact, the \emph{meaning} of the density profile at a liquid-vapor
interface is clouded by the existence of long-wavelength perturbations
known as \emph{capillary waves}.  These waves are not accounted for in
density-functional theory (although the \emph{exact}
density-functionaly theory \emph{would} include them), with the result
that the density profile will be smoothed out by CW effects.
