Write a program to do surface-tension calculations by putting an
infinite barrier at one spot, and adjusting the chemical potential
until we have a liquid-vapor interface and then setting the chemical
potential back to its desired value and re-relaxing.  Or perhaps
fixing the density at vapor and liquid densities at two planes in
space?
