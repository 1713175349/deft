There is a disagreement between the surface_tension function and the
version used in the test suite.  See `tests/surface-tension.cpp`.

> It turned out that the problem was just that I changed the
  resolution, causing the computed surface tension to change
  dramatically.  Increasing the resolution brought the two approaches
  into much better agreement.
